Faduyile has it that there is nothing the Chinese doctors are coming to add as value in Nigeria, that there are countries to which the Chinese have been invited to assist them and where the problem of COVID-19 has not abated, and that, essentially, the problem is that the coming of Chinese doctors to Nigeria has the potential to breach the medical regulations in the country. One critical issue cannot but be raised following the concerns of the NMA: could the medical team have come to treat the Chinese in Nigeria without any prior understanding with the Government of Nigeria? If there was no understanding, why did the government officials receive the Chinese doctors at the airport? Put differently, how would it have been possible for the CCECC to have easily breached all immigration rules and bring the Chinese doctors? And if there was an understanding, why was the NMA not carried along? If the Chinese in Nigeria prefer to be treated by Chinese doctors, could there not be the consideration that the Chinese have their own peculiar medicine also considered better than that of Nigeria?

Addressing questions over how the number had been collated, testing programme coordinator John Newton said that home testing kits were being included in the number of tests completed at the point they were sent out, not when they were analysed.. Since then, the government has increased the number of drive-through testing sites, begun sending out home tests and has rapidly expanded the number of people eligible to apply for a test.\n",

The data, produced by the official Public Health England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, records the number of deaths in a 24-hour reporting period.. The discrepancy between these two totals is because the NHS England figure records the date when deaths are reported by hospitals, which is not necessarily the same day they occurred.\n",

      "4376 :  The Spanish government announced on Thursday that it will set slots to allow limited departures to its citizens from Saturday, on a day in which the country announced its lowest number of daily deaths since March 20.According to the Ministry of Health, Spain recorded 268 new deaths, bringing the death total to 24,543, the fourth highest balance in the world behind the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom.The country has remained in the last five days around 300 deaths a day, away from the death toll in early April, when 950 deaths were recorded in 24 hours.All this occurs after seven weeks of severe confinement, during which the Spaniards could only leave to work if it was not possible to do it from home or for basic activities such as buying food or medicines or walking the dog. These restrictions, decreed on 14 March, began to relax the previous weekend, with the authorization of departures for children under 14 years of age for one hour a day.Celebrating that the country is \"achieving its objectives\", Health Minister Salvador Illa confirmed the new \"relief measures\" planned for Saturday: the possibility of going out to do sports individually or walking with a person living under the same roof.But, to avoid the accumulation of people who were seen on the first day of departure of children, the ministry established different slots for these departures in the municipalities of more than 5000 inhabitants.Adults who want to walk or play sports will be able to do so at two daily intervals, while older adults will be reserved for differentiated stripes, just like children.\"It's about ordering the day a little bit so there's as little agglomeration as possible,\" the minister said.In Barcelona, to increase the space available to pedestrians, they decided to open 70 closed public parks since the beginning of confinement and ban traffic in a street quarantine.

Also, by prohibiting persons from leaving isolation centres without permission from the NCDC DG and requiring them to submit to any medical treatment that he deems fit, the Bill effectively permits physical torture and detention without trial!
