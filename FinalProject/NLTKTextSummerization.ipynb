Faduyile has it that there is nothing the Chinese doctors are coming to add as value in Nigeria, that there are countries to which the Chinese have been invited to assist them and where the problem of COVID-19 has not abated, and that, essentially, the problem is that the coming of Chinese doctors to Nigeria has the potential to breach the medical regulations in the country. One critical issue cannot but be raised following the concerns of the NMA: could the medical team have come to treat the Chinese in Nigeria without any prior understanding with the Government of Nigeria? If there was no understanding, why did the government officials receive the Chinese doctors at the airport? Put differently, how would it have been possible for the CCECC to have easily breached all immigration rules and bring the Chinese doctors? And if there was an understanding, why was the NMA not carried along? If the Chinese in Nigeria prefer to be treated by Chinese doctors, could there not be the consideration that the Chinese have their own peculiar medicine also considered better than that of Nigeria?

      "3528 :  Since the detection of COVID-19 in the index case in Liberia in March, the Liberian COVID-19 Case Management System has reportedly been carrying out community testing of dead bodies of people not previously under its observation, but coming out with \"positive\" laboratory test results for \"COVID-19.\". Nyan then recommended that, \"public health officials should stop testing dead bodies,\" and further proposed that, \"the protocol being used should be revised so as to address this particular issue [of testing dead bodies for COVID-19 infection].\". Dougbeh Chris Nyan has said that, \"Liberia's extremely high case fatality rate of 10-11% is unrealistic and questionable since these numbers come from COVID-19 testing of dead bodies that may not have haboured the virus several hours or days after a person was pronounce dead.\"\n",

      "4376 :  The Spanish government announced on Thursday that it will set slots to allow limited departures to its citizens from Saturday, on a day in which the country announced its lowest number of daily deaths since March 20.According to the Ministry of Health, Spain recorded 268 new deaths, bringing the death total to 24,543, the fourth highest balance in the world behind the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom.The country has remained in the last five days around 300 deaths a day, away from the death toll in early April, when 950 deaths were recorded in 24 hours.All this occurs after seven weeks of severe confinement, during which the Spaniards could only leave to work if it was not possible to do it from home or for basic activities such as buying food or medicines or walking the dog.. Effects on the economySince the government they claim that the epidemic remains under control and highlight the results of confinement.\"We started it on March 14th with 35% contagious numbers (on a daily increase), today we are at 0.6%,\" said the Head of Health.According to his ministry, confirmed cases of the new coronavirus exceed 213,000, while the number of people who have cured the disease is more than 112,000.The restrictions left a major invoice. These restrictions, decreed on 14 March, began to relax the previous weekend, with the authorization of departures for children under 14 years of age for one hour a day.Celebrating that the country is \"achieving its objectives\", Health Minister Salvador Illa confirmed the new \"relief measures\" planned for Saturday: the possibility of going out to do sports individually or walking with a person living under the same roof.But, to avoid the accumulation of people who were seen on the first day of departure of children, the ministry established different slots for these departures in the municipalities of more than 5000 inhabitants.Adults who want to walk or play sports will be able to do so at two daily intervals, while older adults will be reserved for differentiated stripes, just like children.\"It's about ordering the day a little bit so there's as little agglomeration as possible,\" the minister said.In Barcelona, to increase the space available to pedestrians, they decided to open 70 closed public parks since the beginning of confinement and ban traffic in a street quarantine.\n",

COVID-19 has been retrospectively diagnosed in a man treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) near Paris after coughing up blood on Dec 27, 2019—4 days before the novel coronavirus cluster was identified in Wuhan, China.. The authors noted that they may have missed some coronavirus cases because RT-PCR can produce false-negative results, freezing may have damaged the quality of the samples, lab contamination may have occurred, and they limited the analysis to ICU patients who had symptoms and CT findings consistent with COVID-19, while most patients have mild symptoms.\n",

A plagiarised version of Singapore's Infectious Diseases Control Act, it suspiciously passed both its first and second \"reading\" in one sitting despite the fact that the majority of legislators had neither received a copy of it nor had any idea of its contents!

Disregarding basic human rights, it seeks to empower the police, health officers, and anyone else directed by the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) Director-General (DG) to arrest any suspect for breach of any of its 80 provisions with neither the need for a warrant of arrest, nor any reasonable evidence that a crime has been committed! Also, by prohibiting persons from leaving isolation centres without permission from the NCDC DG and requiring them to submit to any medical treatment that he deems fit, the Bill effectively permits physical torture and detention without trial!
