Title : Flu shot shortage
Ariticle : 
MACKAY healthcare workers are calling for a better distribution of influenza shots as the region runs dry ahead of flu season.
Mackay Discount Drug Store’s David Aprile is out of stock and has called on the government to distribute the supply of vaccinations more fairly.
“I don’t think there is a shortage of the vaccinations nationally but I’m not sure where they are going and I think the distribution is disjointed,” Mr Aprile said.
Tony Ware from the Chemist Discount Centre said the shortage of the vaccinations was a problem throughout the area.“The demand for flu vaccinations spiked over the last three months as people became more aware of viruses due to Covid-19,” Mr Ware said.
