From week 1 to 52 of 2019, a total of 48 cases of bubonic plague including eight deaths have been reported in the country.
Plague is an 
infectious disease
 caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis. It is found inanimals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, 
prairie dogs
, chipmunks, rabbits and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague.
People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation and in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person.
Yersinia pestis is treatable with antibiotics if started early enough.
There are three forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

Bubonic plague is the most common form. In this form, the bacteria enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. Here the bacteria infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to week, the person will experience 
fever
, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes.
Untreated
 bubonic plague is fatal about half the time.
