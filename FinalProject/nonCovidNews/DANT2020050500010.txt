Title : Successfully developing the &quot;smart knife&quot; helps to quickly detect cancer
Ariticle : 

According to the authors&#39; sharing, this device works based on the analysis of metabolic state inside living tissue, by mass spectrometry method.

Specifically, the &quot;smart knife&quot; - essentially a handheld thermoelectric device - will reach the target tissue through the cervix, then convert a small portion of the tissue into aerosol form, then transfer to Universal block machine adopts suction pipe. This aerosol mixture will then be analyzed immediately to identify tissue status.


It is known that in the evaluation test with 16 samples of healthy cervical tissue, 50 samples of cervical tissue positive for HPV virus and 21 samples of cervical tissue with cancer, this device was able to determine with sensitivity and specificity reached 100%.

With this result, the team expects to be able to quickly use the &quot;smart knife&quot; in the operating room, thereby allowing doctors to decide whether to perform a biopsy or excision. his tissue approached.

&quot;To be able to be used, we need to test this device on more tissue samples to assess its accuracy, as well as to delineate the types of tissue and type of cancer that the device works well. Best. At the present time, we only stop at cervical cancer ‚Äù- Representatives of the research team said.
