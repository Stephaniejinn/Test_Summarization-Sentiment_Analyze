“To stop the disease caused by Zika virus, we have to kill larvae. However, do not propagate directly but must go directly to each household for guidance. &quot;

After that, Ms. Thu conducted a field survey in some households. It is worth mentioning that almost every home has water stagnant objects and cast iron tombs.

Unsatisfied with this situation, Ms. Thu provided direct comments to the households and instructed how to eliminate the larvae. She said: “Brass, pots do not use upside down to not stagnant water. Keep the water tightly closed to prevent the mosquitoes from reproducing ... ”.

“During the working session, the locality reported many times to propagandize households to kill the larvae. However, when surveying in reality, I still find larvae in many households. This proves that the local propaganda is not effective ”- Ms. Thu reminded.

According to Dr. Nguyen Tri Dung, Director of Ho Chi Minh City Preventive Medical Center, District 12 currently has four Zika virus infections. All four cases were in Hiep Thanh ward (Quarter 4 and Quarter 7).
