2020 MAY 1 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Drug Week -- Data detailed on Mosquito-Borne Diseases - Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever have been presented. According to news reporting out of Tamil Nadu, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "The leaves of Psidium guajava (PG) and Justicia adhatoda (JA) are traditionally used in the Indian herbal medicine for the treatment of dengue. The current research work was aimed to evaluate the antiviral activity of the phytoniosomes (PN) loaded with the aqueous extracts of PG and JA (AGN) against dengue virus-2 strain (DEN-2)."
Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Pharmaceutical, "The AGN were prepared by ultrasonication method using tween 80, poloxamer 407, polyethylene glycol 6000 and cholesterol. The particle size of the PN was found out to be in the range of 105.1 +/- 3.6-279.4 +/- 5.2 nm. In comparison to the non-PEGylated niosomes, PEGylated niosomes showed lower particle size. AGN showed in vitro antiviral activity against vero cells infected with DEN-2 virus. Capsules containing AGN powder were found to be stable for 3 months when stored at room temperature."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "AGN4 showed maximum of 40% plaque forming units, indicating that formulation poses significant viral inhibition in in vitro condition."
