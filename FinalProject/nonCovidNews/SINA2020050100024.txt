Original title: Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng: The epidemic data reported by China can withstand inspection and reflect &quot;Chinese experience&quot;, not &quot;Chinese concealment&quot;
On April 28, 2020, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng was interviewed by NBC Television. In response to questions from the outside world that China deliberately concealed the epidemic data, Le Yucheng said that behind these data are real people, which cannot be concealed anyway. On the contrary, some countries describe the new coronary pneumonia as influenza, which is concealment. At present, China is fully implementing the resumption of production and production. Wuhan has been unsealed. If the figures are not true, do we dare to do so? Our revision of the data reflects a responsible attitude, which is also a common practice internationally. As far as I know, New York has also revised its data not long ago. Questioning the number of confirmed diagnoses and deaths in China is a great disrespect to the 1.4 billion Chinese people, especially millions of medical personnel! These figures just show that we responded appropriately, reflecting &quot;Chinese experience&quot; rather than &quot;Chinese concealment.&quot;
