Original title: Zhong Nanshan: I do n’t approve of group immunization, which sacrifices many people
On the evening of May 4, Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, connected with overseas students on the occasion of the Youth Day. According to the current situation of international anti-epidemic, it proposed scientific and effective anti-epidemic recommendations to international students from various countries. Regarding the theory of group immunization, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that he did not approve of this method, because it would take a lot of people to get group immunization, and the number of infected countries in countries with high prevalence is still far from being able to do group immunization.
Zhong Nanshan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering: 20% also exists in Europe, the highest report is 25%, this figure is far from the so-called group immunity. This disease group is generally immunized, and it usually takes 6 to 70% of people to become infected. This is now possible, and now more than 20% is far from being reached. I don&#39;t quite agree with this approach. Many people have to be sacrificed. Even 1% is more than ten to twenty times higher than the flu, and even one hundred times. If you are 2%, 3%, that is even more terrible, because you have to sacrifice a lot of people to get group immunity. I don&#39;t think this method is feasible. We have many ways. We can prevent it, we can protect it, we will fight for time, and we will make vaccines. I don&#39;t think we can rely on this so-called group immunization in China.
