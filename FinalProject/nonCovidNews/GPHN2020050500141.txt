Title : BBC: According to a French doctor, the country's first corona infection would have occurred as early as December*** TRANSLATED ***
Ariticle : 
The doctor re-examined samples of patients with flu symptoms tested in December.
A French man was diagnosed with a coronary infection as early as December, says Yves Cohen, the doctor who treated the patient.
News about the matter, among other things BBC.
Cohen, who works as the head of the emergency department, says he recently reviewed several patient records from patients suffering from flu symptoms in December and January. At the same time, he tested samples taken from 14 patients for coronavirus.
The test gave a positive result for a 50-year-old French man. In December, his illness was diagnosed as pneumonia.
According to Cohen, the test was repeated twice more to ensure that there was no erroneous result.
Indeed, Cohen has now wondered whether that patient could be the so-called patient zero from which French coronary infections began to spread. However, he said, it is too early to confirm.
It is not known where the patient got the virus
Now the fully recovered man says he has no idea where he may have gotten the virus. The man had not traveled to areas where the disease had been detected. However, his wife had worked near a place where people of Chinese background also worked. It has now been considered whether they may have traveled to Wuhan.
Earlier in France, it has been reported that the countryâ€™s first corona infection would have been found on January 24th.
Cohen's information has not been confirmed by other doctors or health authorities. According to the French radio station RFI, Cohen has now reported his findings to the French health authorities.
