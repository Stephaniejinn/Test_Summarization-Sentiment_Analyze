2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- Current study results on Staphylococcus aureus have been published. According to news reporting from Tehran University of Medical Sciences by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Introduction:Staphylococcal food poisoning is one of the most common food-borne diseases. The antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus has been reported globally."
The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Tehran University of Medical Sciences: "Today, strains of Staphylococcus aureus in food have become a problem in clinical infections and are considerde as a serious public health concern. A total of 100 samples were tested in the laboratory; including 75 handmade and 25 industrial hamburger samples. The Staphylococcus aureus samples were isolated and identified according to the National Iranian Standard No. 6806-3. Antibiotic resistance was determined by disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration was performed. In this study, the antibiotics penicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, gentamicin, vancomycin, and oxacillin were used. Of 100 analyzed hamburger samples, 39 samples were infected with Staphylococcus aureus (23 industrial and 16 handmade samples). All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (100%) were susceptible to gentamicin and vancomycin antibiotics."
According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Due to the importance of Staphylococcus aureus, as the supergene antigen and its role in causing food poisoning, contamination of foodstuffs with Staphylococcus aureus can threaten the consumers' health."
