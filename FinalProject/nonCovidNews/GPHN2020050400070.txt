Title : Clinic flat out with demand for flu shots
Ariticle : 
A BURNETT medical centre is trying to keep up with the demand of flu needles this year, administering roughly 700 jabs in two weeks.
Coronavirus fears have elevated the need for the vaccine in the North Burnett, with Mundubbera Medical Centre being swamped by patients.
Practice manager Jasmine Adams said the pandemic still had the centre run off its feet, even after cases in Queensland were rapidly decreasing.
“We’ve been absolutely flat-out, especially coming into flu season,” Mrs Adams said.
“We’ve had to give our staff extra hours to cope with the increase in phone calls, as well as keeping up with public health recommendations.” The practice has extended its opening hours during the pandemic, now open 7.30am–­6pm weekdays, even opening a drive-through flu clinic.
With the winter months approaching, they’ve seen a large influx of high-risk patients wanting their free flu vaccine.
“We receive government stock here for those over 65 and people with chronic health problems who fall in the high-risk zones,” Mrs Adams said.
“The free vaccines for them started a couple of weeks ago and our aim was to get as many chronic illness and elderly patients immunised as quickly as possible.” The increase in demand had seen Guardian Pharmacy in Mundubbera create a ­waiting list for the vaccine, Mrs Adams said, as they hadn’t been given a date for their next delivery of guaranteed stock.“We now have to work out a plan on what we’re doing to do with all these un-immunised people in the meantime,” she said.
