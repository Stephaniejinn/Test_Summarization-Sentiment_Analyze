Title : DELIVER FACTS, AVOID SPECULATION
Ariticle : 
THE Covid-19 pandemic is an ongoing disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, identified in Wuhan, China, in December last year. Up to April 11 — a little over four months — the number of confirmed cases are 1,699,019; recovered 376,976 and deaths 102,774. This is not the first time an international health crisis occurred due to the spread of a novel coronavirus or zoonotic (animal-originated) virus. We have had various types of influenza, similarly deadly, like the swine, bird and seasonal flu epidemics. Seasonal flu alone results in 3 to 5 million severe illness cases, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths annually. So should we be more conscious of Covid-19? Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also caused by a coronavirus, was first reported in 2002 in Guangdong, southern China. From November 2002 till July 2003, the disease had been contained, but there were sporadic cases until May 2014, when the last case was reported.
 By then, 8,098 people had been infected with 774 deaths. In 2009, the swine flu, a new strain from the original H1N1 influenza virus, came to the world’s attention, as did the Spanish flu in 1918-1920. The virus appeared as a result from a reassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus. However, studies have shown that while more people were infected by the swine flu, the mortality rate was much lower than people who died after contracting the Spanish flu. A study in September 2010 by D.J. DeNoon showed that the risk of serious illness resulting from the 2009 H1N1 flu was no higher than that of yearly seasonal flu. In comparison, R. Roos says that the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 250,000 to 500,000 people die of seasonal flu annually. Another disease that spooked the world was the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Al-Jazeera states that up to March, 2,521 MERS cases had been confirmed globally with 866 deaths, mainly in Saudi Arabia. According to WHO, dromedary camels are a large reservoir host for MERS and animal source of MERS infection in humans. All three have similar symptoms: high fever, headache and body aches, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ranging from mild symptoms to severe respiratory problems. Death may follow if ventilation equipment does not help or if the patient is too far gone. There is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment to treat Covid-19. The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. So at first glance, masks and personal hygiene are at the top of the pyramid of keeping the virus at bay. Will that be good enough to start life at a “new normal”? How do we move forward? What is important is that some balance will eventually have to be struck between epidemiological and economic objectives. The United Kingdom view seems to be that the lockdown measures will have to stay in place until there is evidence that shows they have moved beyond the peak, according to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Another step might be to plan an exit strategy that allows young people to be the first to resume their lives, said Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College London and scientific adviser to the British government. The other significant factor when relaxing the rules is to allow those working in the private sector to be released early as they are more likely to be affected financially. A prolonged lockdown would lead to more than economic losses. We need to be prepared for an increase in physical and mental illness, deaths, and extreme levels of debt. As Florian Adamski, chief executive officer of OMD Worldwide, puts it, we need to be transparent. Transparency is the key to success. Facts must be delivered and not speculation. Everything will happen at light speed to compensate for any slowdowns experienced, and it will be a game of the gazelle that runs the fastest.
