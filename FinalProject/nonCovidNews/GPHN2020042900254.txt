Title : Calls for PAHO not to neglect vaccination
Ariticle : 
Vaccinations of diseases such as influenza and measles have to be administered in conjunction with the response to Covid-19, recommended Bysissa Etienne, PAHO Director and WHO Regional Director for the Americas.
"We must vaccinate people to protect people from other diseases such as influenza, or pneumococcal and measles, which can lead to more hospitalizations.
"We run the risk of outbreaks, beating hospitals and clinics with preventable diseases in addition to Covid-19 the impact on our health system would take months or years to reverse it," she said.
He indicated that this would work for the countries of America to ensure that they are ready to administer the Covid-19 vaccine.
"History has shown us that after wars or epidemics we allow huge gaps in vaccination," Etienne said.
He noted that at least three countries were currently working to contain the measles outbreak in Latin America.
