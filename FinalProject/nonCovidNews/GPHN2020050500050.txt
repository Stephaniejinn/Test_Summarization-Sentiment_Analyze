Title : Special Covid-19 centre ready to help
Ariticle : 
A CORONAVIRUS respiratory clinic will open today in Sippy Downs as part of the Federal Government’s $2.4 billion health package.
The Sippy Downs GP Respiratory Clinic, which will be located next to Ochre Medical Centre, will be one of up to 100 that the Australian Government is sponsoring in rural and regional locations across the country. It’s been established to assess any patients with mild-to-moderate respiratory or flu-like symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, cough, runny nose, or shortness of breath, separately from general patients.
Ochre Health director of medical services, Dr John Hall, said the clinic would enable more people to be tested for Covid-19, and for positive cases to be identified and isolated quickly.
Federal Member for Fisher Andrew Wallace will join the Ochre Health team at the launch of the clinic today.Appointments can be made without a GP referral, and there is also no charge for people who present to the clinic with symptoms.
