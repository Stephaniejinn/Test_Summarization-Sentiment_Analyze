Title : Screven doctor treated soldiers during Spanish Flu Pandemic
Ariticle : 
As the county, the nation and the world reel from the coronavirus pandemic, it may be helpful to remember that the world has survived pandemics in the past.
Screven native Odeen L. Tyre has family connections with a Screven doctor who treated patients during the Spanish Influenza Pandemic of 1918â€”and survived.
Tyre, a retired Navy commander and a family historian, relates that his cousin Joseph Lawton Tyre, born on Feb. 18, 1886, in Screven, was working as a physician in Screven when he was called up for service in World War I.
As part of his service in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, Dr. Tyre treated soldiers who suffered from the Spanish flu, and in the camp where he worked in Duval County, Florida, 42 soldiers died on Sept. 20, 1918.
Camp Johnston was quarantined on Oct. 6, and of the 17,000 troops stationed there, 1,032 were reported to be sick with the flu. Another 155 were reported dead on Oct. 19, and by Dec. 24, when the quarantine was lifted, 398 had died.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Spanish Influence Pandemic was the most severe in recent history and spread worldwide during 1918-19.
"In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world's population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States," according to information on the CDC website.
Dr. Tyre returned home to Screven on Dec. 27 and continued to work in his clinic there, where he served as the attending physician for the birth of both Odeen Tyre (in 1947) and Benny Osborne Lee Tyre (in 1949).
Odeen L. Tyre reports that Dr. Tyre accepted crops, hay and livestock in exchange for his professional services from the boys' parents, Odeen and Catherine Tyre.
Dr. Tyre and his wife, Bertie Mae Walker Tyre, had two sons, Joseph Jr., who died in 1916, and Elkin Mayo Tyre, who died in 1965.
Dr. Tyre died in Chatham County Oct. 3, 1952, and was buried in the Screven City Cemetery. His wife was buried beside him June 25, 1984.
The CDC story on the Spanish flu shows other similarities with the current pandemic, as well as stark contrasts.
"Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. While the 1918 H1N1 virus has been synthesized and evaluated, the properties that made it so devastating are not well understood," the CDC reports says.
"With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly."
