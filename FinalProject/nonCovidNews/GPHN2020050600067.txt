Title : 68 influenza, another pandemic that emerged in China that left thousands of victims in Europe and the United States
Ariticle : 
52 years after the detection of the first coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China, the 68-year flu began to wreak havoc among the population of Hong Kong,before expanding beyond Asia. Months later, fatalities caused by this virus were counted from thousands in Europe and the United States.
"People of all ages came on a stretcher, in a catastrophic state. He died of pulmonary hemorrhage, with cyanosis on his lips, completely gray," the infectologist Pierre Dellamonica, interviewed by the newspaper Lib√©ration, which is published in Paris, France, had described in 2005.
For his part, the health historian Patrice Bourdelais reminded the AFP: "In December 1969, the bodies were piled up in hospitals and morgues. But the 31,000 Hong Kong Influenza victims in France did not create any scandals. In the multidimensional progress curve of that time, an accident like a deadly flu was not so intolerable."
The '68 Flu caused more than a million deaths worldwide.
Unlike covid-19 - rapidly expanding on five continents - the H3N2 Influenza virus took several months to cross the borders of Southeast Asia. In 1968 and the following year, the death toll exceeded one million worldwide (mostly over 65 years of age), of which about 100 thousand are infected in the United States.
Most of the victims affected by the Hong Kong Influenza were people over 65 years of age.
However, the issue went almost unnoticed in the press and public opinion in the late 1960s. Most governments did not take preventive measures and did not declare a state of "health emergency." More than half a century later, seasonal influenza A virus continues to circulate globally and threatens, especially, people suffering from serious illnesses.
Specialists found that The 68 Flu is a seasonal influenza A virus.
