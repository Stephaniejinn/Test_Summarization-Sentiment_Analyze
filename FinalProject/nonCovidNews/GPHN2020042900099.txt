Title : Bovine Diseases and Conditions - Bovine Brucellosis; University of la Republica Researchers Have Published New Data on Bovine Brucellosis (Analytic Sensitivity of an ELISA Test on Pooled Sera Samples for Detection of Bovine Brucellosis in Eradication Staâ€¦

2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- Current study results on bovine brucellosis have been published. According to news originating from Montevideo, Uruguay, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Bovine brucellosis has been under eradication in Uruguay since 1998. The eradication program includes, among other interventions, individual sera sampling of beef animals at slaughter, and annual serum testing of all dairy cows-accounting for two million samples annually."
The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of la Republica: "At a herd prevalence of 0.8%, a pooled-sera sample approach could reduce the economic burden of the surveillance system by reducing the testing and operational costs. Our objective was to evaluate the analytic sensitivity of an indirect ELISA test for Brucella abortus in serum pools. Sixty-two Brucella abortus-positive bovine sera samples (based upon rose bengal and fluorescent polarization assay) were used as the positive control samples. Rose bengal-negative sera from negative farms were used to dilute the positive samples to the desired concentrations. Positive samples were diluted by using 1 ml of positive sera and 1 ml of negative sera (1/2 dilution) up to 1/1,024. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with a binary outcome (positive or negative), dilution number as a fixed effect, and a random effect for sample ID. Analytic sensitivity was 99.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.3-99.7], 98.3% (95% CI: 93.1-99.6), 97.3% (95% CI: 87.4-99.4) for dilutions 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, respectively."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "The analytical sensitivity, however, decreased when diluted to greater proportions. Given the current herd prevalence in Uruguay, it seems plausible that the use of a pooled sample approach could be adopted by policymakers to reduce the cost of the surveillance program and increase the number of samples being tested."
