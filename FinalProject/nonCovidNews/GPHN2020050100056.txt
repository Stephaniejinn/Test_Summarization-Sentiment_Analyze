Title : Four Asean nations among 38 to get Avigan drug from Japan for clinical trial
Ariticle : 
Japan is preparing to send Avigan, a drug used for treating influenza, to 38 countries this week, with four Asean countries -- the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar -- joining the trial for Covid-19 patients.
Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi said that Avigan, also known as Favipiravir, would be dispatched this week free of charge to be used in experiments to treat patients with Covid-19.
"The drug is effective in treating patients with Covid-19, especially in people with mild symptoms," added Motegi.
Moteki said Japan would work with countries receiving the drug to expand clinical research on the efficacy of treating patients with Covid-19.
Japan will also give US$1 million to the United Nation to buy and deliver the medicine to the countries in need.
