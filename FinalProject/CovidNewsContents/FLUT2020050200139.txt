Abstract

As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) takes its course outside China, the number of imported cases to other countries is on the rise. Currently, Tanzania has received the first imported case on 16 March 2020. This letter serves to describe this specific event and put forth a number of recommendations including establishing more testing points, discouraging all forms of public and religious gatherings, and tailoring a unique model for lockdown and social distancing to prevent further spread of the disease. The letter has also suggested ways to further improve the efforts already in place so as to strengthen the prevention and control system.
