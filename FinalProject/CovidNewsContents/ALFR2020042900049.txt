The Lagos NCoS boss, who was represented by the Command's Public Relations Officer, Rotimi Oladokun, said the 204 prisoners would be released from all the Custodial centres in Lagos.
Mr Iyakoregha said 53 inmates would be released from the Ikoyi Correctional facility and 18 from the Badagry Custodial centre.
He added that nine inmates from the Female Custodial centre, Kirikiri, 89 from the Medium custodial centre, Kirikiri, and 35 others from the Maximum Custodial center in Kirikiri, Lagos would also regain their freedom.
The NCoS boss commended the federal government for its magnanimity toward the Correctional Service in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak.
He further urged the inmates to be of good behaviour when reintegrated into the society adding that any act of lawlessness on their part would not be tolerated.
The Controller noted all hands were on deck at the Lagos command to ensure that quality services were provided always.
