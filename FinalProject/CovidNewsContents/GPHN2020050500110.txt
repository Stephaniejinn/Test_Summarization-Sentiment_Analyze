UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock laid out details on Monday of their planned “test, track and trace” program to identify and track those with coronavirus symptoms, including the track and trace app that will be trialed on the Isle of Wight, off the southern coast of England, starting Tuesday.
Hancock said the app from the National Health Service would respect privacy concerns, and information would be logged securely on people’s phones, and added that a Bluetooth signal used would conserve battery life. He also said the program would allow the government to take a “more targeted” approach to the lockdown.
The government announced the death toll rose by 288 on Monday to 28,734.
