This is the second extension, of 15 days, of the exceptional regime, this time with a slight relaxation of the measures. The State of Emergency was decreed on March 25 by the President of the Republic, João Lourenço, after a favourable opinion from the National Assembly (parliament) and was in force from March 27 to April 10, having been extended to the period that goes from 11 to 25 of the current month. In the framework of the extension, among restrictions and openings, the circulation and permanence of people on the public road is also prohibited, the use of masks is now mandatory for everyone who goes out or exposes themselves in public places. Among the impositions, in these new 15 days of sanitary fencing, there remains the obligation for workers assigned to essential services, from the public and private sectors, to be accompanied by credential and badge.
