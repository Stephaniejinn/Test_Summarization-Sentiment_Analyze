Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a worldwide outbreak with several millions of people infected and more than 160.000 deaths. A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm. This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.
