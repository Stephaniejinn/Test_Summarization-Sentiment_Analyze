BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, will partially reopen from May 1, the first day of a five-day public holiday, according to a notice on its website.
Visitors need to make reservations online, and the daily number of visitors is limited to 5,000, said the notice.
The Palace Museum stopped admitting visitors from Jan. 25 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The year 2020 marks the 600th anniversary of the Forbidden City. The Palace Museum was built on the base of the former imperial compound in 1925.
