To date, Vietnam recorded a total of 271 new-type coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-2), of which 131 were from foreign countries. In the past 19 days, there has been no infection in the community.
Regarding re-positive cases, Mr. Nguyen Van Kinh - senior hospital specialist - said that all re-positive patients admitted to the hospital were cultured but the virus did not grow, the patient had a re-result. A positive result may be due to a test that detects the viral genome, not the active virus.
