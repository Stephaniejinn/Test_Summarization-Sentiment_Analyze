On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin extended national paid leave and self-isolation measures to May 11, and has ordered the government to prepare for the gradual lifting of restrictions from May 12.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Thursday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating. Putin has ordered First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov to temporarily perform Mishustin's duties in the meantime.
"The easing of the restrictions introduced in Russia due to the spread of the coronavirus will begin with short walks of two or three people, with morning runs that will be allowed, physical education and sports on the street, walks with children, but, of course, in limited groups of people with observance of social distance," Anna Popova, head of national well-being agency Rospotrebnadzor, told TASS news agency on Friday.
Self-isolation measures may be eased if the number of infections decreases, Popova said, adding that there are sufficient beds and equipment available to perform detection tests.
