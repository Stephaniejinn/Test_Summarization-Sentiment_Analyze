“Every region, every province, every territory is facing a very different situation right now with different industries, different-sized cities, and different spread of COVID-19,” said Trudeau.
“That’s why we needed to make sure that the foundational elements were there, that we could all follow as Canadians, but recognize that different jurisdictions will act differently.”
