An outbreak of COVID-19 was reported at St. Gabriel Villa long-term care home on Saturday after a case was confirmed in an employee of the Sudbury facility. 
The latest case is a Greater Sudbury woman in her 50s who was tested on April 28 and has since been instructed to self-isolate, said Public Health Sudbury and Districts in a release. 
It is not known at this time how she may have contracted the virus, as she has not recently returned from travel abroad and is not believed to have been in close contact with another case.
There are now four active outbreaks at long-term care facilities in the area, that have resulted in four residents and seven staff members contracting the disease, the others being at St. Joseph's Villa, Pioneer Manor, and Extendicare York.
On Friday, it was announced that one of these cases passed away from complications related to the virus after being diagnosed on April 21.
