Russian President Vladimir Putin has extended to May 11 national paid leave and self-isolation and ordered the government to prepare a plan for the gradual lifting of restrictions related to the pandemic from May 12.
Currently, Russian regions have mostly introduced self-isolation or some other restrictions. People are allowed to go out only for medical care, work, shopping at the nearest store or pharmacy or walking a pet.
In Moscow and several other regions, digital passes have been introduced to regulate travel by personal or public transport means.
Anna Popova, head of Rospotrebnadzor, told Rossia-24 TV channel on Sunday that if Russians keep violating calls to self isolate, restrictions may be extended until June.
