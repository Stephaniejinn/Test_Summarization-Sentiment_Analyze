Title : Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Reduce your risk of getting sick with COVID-19:
Ariticle : 
Avoid your  asthma triggers.
If possible, have another member of your household who doesn’t have asthma clean and disinfect your house for you. When they use cleaning and disinfecting products, have them:
Make sure that people with asthma are not in the room.
Minimize use of disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack.
Open windows or doors and use a fan that blows air outdoors.
Always follow the instructions on the product label.
Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows).
Why you might be at higher risk
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness.
Chronic lung disease
Chronic lung diseases, such as  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Keep taking your current medications, including those with steroids in them (“steroids” is another word for corticosteroids).
Avoid triggers that make your symptoms worse.
Why you might be at higher risk
Based on data from other viral respiratory infections, COVID-19 might cause flare-ups of chronic lung diseases leading to severe illness.
Diabetes
Diabetes , including type 1, type 2, or gestational, may put people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Follow the  sick day guidelines for people with diabetes .
Why you might be at higher risk
People with diabetes whose blood sugar levels are often higher than their target are more likely to have  diabetes-related health problems . Those health problems can make it harder to overcome COVID-19.
Serious heart conditions
Serious  heart conditions , including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Take your medication exactly as prescribed. Continue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) as prescribed by your healthcare provider for indications such as heart failure or high blood pressure. This is recommended by  current clinical guidelines .
Make sure that you have at least a two-week supply of your heart disease medications (such as those to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure).
People with hypertension should continue to manage and control their blood pressure and take their medication as directed.
Why you might be at higher risk
COVID-19, like other viral illnesses such as the flu, can damage the respiratory system and make it harder for your heart to work. For people with heart failure and other serious heart conditions this can lead to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.
Chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis
Chronic kidney disease  being treated with dialysis may increase a person’s risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Plan to have enough food on hand to follow the  KCER 3-Day Emergency Diet Plan pdf iconpdf icon[PDF – 8 pages]external iconexternal icon  for dialysis patients in case you are unable to maintain your normal treatment schedule.
Why you might be at higher risk
Dialysis patients are more prone to infection and severe illness because of weakened immune systems; treatments and procedures to manage kidney failure; and coexisting conditions such as diabetes.
Severe obesity
Severe  obesity , defined as a  body mass index  (BMI) of 40 or above, puts people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19.
 Actions to take
Take your medications for any underlying health conditions exactly as prescribed.
Why you might be at higher risk
Severe obesity increases the risk of a serious breathing problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major complication of COVID-19 and can cause difficulties with a doctor’s ability to provide respiratory support for seriously ill patients. People living with severe obesity can have multiple serious chronic diseases and underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
People aged 65 years and older
Older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Take your medications for any underlying health conditions exactly as prescribed.
Follow the advice of your healthcare provider.
Develop a  care plan  that summarizes your health conditions and current treatments.
Prepare yourself to stay home for long periods using  this checklist .
Why you might be at higher risk
Although COVID-19 can affect any group, the older you are, the higher your risk of serious disease. Eight out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in  adults 65 years or older ; risk of death is highest among those 85 years or older. The immune systems of older adults weaken with age, making it harder to fight off infections. Also, older adults commonly have chronic diseases that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
Many cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have occurred among older adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities
Actions to take
Carefully follow your facility’s instructions for infection prevention.
Notify staff right away if you feel sick.
Ask your caretakers about the actions that are being taken at your nursing home or long-term care facility to protect you and your loved ones, including if and how they are limiting visitors.
Why you might be at higher risk
The communal nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, and the population served (generally older adults often with underlying medical conditions), put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness from COVID-19.
Immunocompromised
Many conditions and treatments can cause a person to have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised), including  cancer  treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies,  HIV  with a low CD4 cell count or not on HIV treatment, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications.
Actions to take
If you are immunocompromised, continue any recommended medications or treatments and follow the advice of your healthcare provider.
Call your healthcare provider if you have concerns about your condition or feel sick.
Why you might be at higher risk
People with a weakened immune system have reduced ability to fight infectious diseases, including viruses like COVID-19. Knowledge is limited about the virus that causes COVID-19, but based on similar viruses, there is concern that immunocompromised patients may remain infectious for longer than other COVID-19 patients.
Liver disease
Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, may increase risk for serious illness from COVID-19.
Actions to take
Take your medications exactly as prescribed.
Why you might be at higher risk
Severe illness caused by COVID-19 and the medications used to treat some severe consequences of COVID-19 can cause strain on the liver, particularly for those with underlying liver problems. People living with serious liver disease can have a weakened immune system, leaving the body less able to fight COVID-19.
Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
