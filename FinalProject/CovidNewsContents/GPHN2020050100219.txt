KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyan cargo truck drivers tested positive for COVID-19 in Uganda on Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 83.
 Out of 2,071 samples run at Uganda Virus Research Institute, samples of a 55-year-old and 27-year-old male truck drivers tested positive for the novel coronavirus,the Ministry of Health said in a statement.
 The Ugandan government last week announced it had agreed on measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.
