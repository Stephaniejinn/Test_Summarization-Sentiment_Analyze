Title : Kenya: Kengen Donates Sh20 Million Towards the COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund
Ariticle : 
NAIROBI, Kenya, Apr Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) PLC has donated Sh20 million towards the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Emergency Response Fund.
The electricity generating company Tuesday handed over the donation to the Fund's Board during a brief ceremony held at the Kenya International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi.
Speaking at the event, the company's Managing Director, Rebecca Miano said KenGen had joined hands with the Government and other stakeholders in offering economic and social support to the vulnerable community members across the country who have been impacted by COVID-19.
"As KenGen, we take this opportunity to thank the Government for establishing the COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund, which has been instrumental in mobilizing resources towards containing the spread, effect and impact of Coronavirus disease," she further said.
The company, she added, had set aside an additional Sh10 million towards supporting World Health Organization (WHO) recommended hygiene efforts among community members living near its installations across the country. The additional cash goes towards the purchase of hand sanitizers, liquid soaps, and water tanks.
Miano pointed out that the COVID-19 situation was challenging to many companies and individuals including KenGen, which she said had been forced to suspend a number of initiatives, but encouraged all organizations both public and private to make sacrifices especially at this time to help stop the spread of the disease.
"We must now stand out and reach out to those in need in a show of unity, patriotism and empathy as a nation and give generously, you can donate your time, we have seen others donate resources, others their expertise, and others moral support including counseling," said Miano.
"It is our prayer that many more organizations and individuals will come forward and contribute towards this noble cause," she continued.
