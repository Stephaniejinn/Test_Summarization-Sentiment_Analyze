"We won't be defeated by any difficulty," said tourist Wu Zhiliang, from the city of Xiaogan, central China's Hubei Province. "The tower's reopening makes me feel confident about the future of Wuhan."

In the old street at the foot of the tower, a variety of shops have reopened and many were preparing for the coming May Day holiday.
