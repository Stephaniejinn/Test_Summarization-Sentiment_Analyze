Original Title: The White House &quot;take the pass&quot; Modi Twitter India is shocked
The White House ’s official account on Twitter on social media removed attention on the official account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 29, sparking discussion in India.
The White House began to follow Twitter accounts related to Modi and the Indian government on April 10, including Indian President Ram Nath Cowand and the Indian Embassy in the United States. New Delhi TV and &quot;India Today&quot; previously reported that Modi was &quot;the only foreign leader in the White House Twitter account except Trump.&quot;
The US side moved from &quot;concern&quot; to &quot;access&quot; within three weeks, which sparked discussions in Indian politics and the media. Rahul Gandhi, leader of the National Congress of India, tweeted on the 29th that he was “frustrated” at the White House ’s “access” and urged the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to it in a timely manner.
In this regard, a high-level US government official who did not wish to disclose his name explained to the Indian Press Trust: The White House Twitter account usually only focuses on US politicians and related people. Only during special periods, including presidential visits, the White House Twitter will temporarily follow leaders and officials of specific countries and forward relevant tweets to show support.
The Indian government announced on April 4 that it banned the export of hydroxychloroquine and related preparations related to the treatment of new coronavirus, causing US dissatisfaction. Trump has hinted that if India does not lift the export ban, it may face retaliation from the US. Soon after, India announced deregulation, and Trump thanked Modi on Twitter.
