Title : S.I. records highest increase of confirmed virus cases in a week
Ariticle : 
Staten Island saw the highest single day-increase in confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases since a week ago, according to the latest data from the New York City Department of Health. On Friday the borough added 138 new cases — the highest one day increase since April 26 when 149 people were added to the tally, the data shows. A total of 753 Staten Islanders have now lost their lives to the virus, an increase of eight since yesterday.
The number of daily deaths has shown a significant downward trend over the past week, and until Friday a daily death total smaller than 10 had not been recorded since March 27. The 753 total deaths include 613 confirmed and 140 probable deaths. A death is classified "probable" if the person had no known positive laboratory test for the coronavirus, but had exhibited symptoms and has a death certificate listing "COVID-19" or an equivalent as the cause.
Another hopeful sign that the virus is loosening its grip on Staten Island is the continued downward trend in hospitalizations: 39 fewer people are being treated for COVID-19 at the borough's hospitals since yesterday. There were 265 coronavirus patients at Staten Island hospitals Saturday, a more than 10% drop from 294 on Friday afternoon.
Richmond University Medical Center (RUMC) is caring for 88 COVID-19 patients, 15 fewer than yesterday, said Alex Lutz a spokesman for the West Brighton hospital. The number of people in the intensive care unit also decreased at RUMC with 31 patients on Saturday as opposed to 45 Friday, Lutz said. Overall, RUMC has discharged 363 coronavirus patients, including 14 in the past 24 hours, according to Lutz.
Staten Island University Hospital (SIUH) is caring for the remaining 177 patients — 147 at the Ocean Breeze location and 30 at the Prince's Bay facility, according to Jillian O'Hara, a spokeswoman for the hospital system. The Ocean Breeze location saw a decrease of 13 COVID-19 patients in the past 24 hours.
