Title : Italy, statistic data: mortality for all causes + 49.4% compared to 2019 in March 2020
Ariticle : 
																							


In March 2020 49.4% more deaths were recorded in Italy than in March 2019. This is what the Istat Report reveals on the impact of the epidemic on mortality, drawn up together with the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, on a sample of 6,866 municipalities (87% of the 7,904 in total). Considering the month of March, the report reads, an increase in deaths of 49.4% at national average level, considering all the causes of death. If we take as a reference the period from the first Covid-19 death reported by the Integrated Surveillance System (February 20) until March 31, the deaths go from 65.592 (average period 2015-2019) to 90.946 in 2020. 
The excess 25,354 died, 54% of whom were diagnosed as Covid-19 deaths (13,710). However, there are 11,600 other 'suspects'
 either because the swab was not performed, or due to organic dysfunction related to the infection or due to indirect mortality but caused by the crisis in the hospital system and the fear of going to the hospital.




The deaths concentrated in 37 northern provinces and in Pesaro-Urbino

But there is no homogeneity in the geographical location of dead people. The report speaks of 'Tre Italie': in the Southern Regions and in the islands, the spread of infections was very limited, in those of the Center, it was on average higher than in the South, while in those of the North the circulation of the virus was very high. The coronavirus struck, and killed, in particular in 38 provinces, 37 in the north plus Pesaro-Urbino. In all of these provinces, deaths from all causes have more than doubled compared to the 2015-2019 average for the month of March. If we consider the period from February 20 to March 31, the deaths have gone from 26.218 to 49.351 (+ 23.133); just over half of this increase (52%) is the deaths reported to the Covid-19 Integrated Surveillance System (12,156). Within this grouping, the provinces most affected by the epidemic paid a very high price in human lives with percentage increases in deaths in March 2020 compared to the three-digit March 2015-2019: Bergamo (568%), Cremona (391 %), Lodi (371%), Brescia (291%), Piacenza (264%), Parma (208%), Lecco (174%), Pavia (133%), Mantua (122%), Pesaro and Urbino (120 %).




At Centrosud fewer deaths than 5 years earlier

In various areas of Italy, those least affected by the virus (largely prevalent in Centrosud) in March 2020 are even fewer dead than the average of the past years: overall, we read in the Istat / Iss report, in low-spread areas (1,817 municipalities, 34 provinces mostly in Central and Southern Italy) the deaths of March 2020 are on average 1.8% lower than the average of the previous five years. The figure of Rome stands out, which in March marks a -9.4% compared to the average mortality of the last 5 years: 3,757 deaths this year, 4,121 on average. Also down Naples, which records a -0.9% mortality.
