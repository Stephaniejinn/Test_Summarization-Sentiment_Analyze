Title : COVID-19 cases stay unchanged
Ariticle : 
SANDPOINT — Panhandle Health District reported no new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Panhandle on Saturday.
Kootenai County has had 62 confirmed cases and Bonner County has had four cases. There are no reported novel coronavirus cases in Boundary, Benewah or Shoshone counties. Forty-eight of the cases are no longer being monitored.
A person is no longer being monitored when they have stayed home for our recommended period of time AND have not had a fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND at least 7 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared).
Details on new cases will be posted on the PHD website in real time.
Five patients in the region were hospitalized due COVID-19. Hospitalizations on the website is a tally of total hospitalizations of confirmed cases. This does not mean these patients are currently hospitalized, only that they were hospitalized for COVID-19 and are also confirmed positive with COVID-19.
PHD will make a daily announcement if there are confirmed cases within the Panhandle at noon, 7 days a week.
The Panhandle area includes the five northern counties — Kootenai, Shoshone, Benewah, Bonner, and Boundary.
People ill with coronavirus in other states and countries have reported mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If community members have these symptoms and are concerned, they should call PHD's call center at 1-877-415-5225 or their provider. PHD will provide an over-the-phone assessment to determine if someone should be tested. Please call, do not come into PHD or your provider's office. Tested individuals must stay home until test results are received. If the test is positive, all household members must self-isolate at home for a recommended period of time.
