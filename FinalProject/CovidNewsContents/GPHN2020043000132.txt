Title : 1,488 Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Bulgaria
Ariticle : 
Sofia, April 30 (BTA) - The confirmed COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria are 1,488, the national coronavirus task force said on Thursday morning. The confirmed cases in 24 hours are 51.
A total of 266 patients have recovered. The recent fatalities are four. Of a total of 310 hospitalized patients, 38 are in intensive care.
Patients recovered from the coronavirus infection have volunteered to donate blood for passive antibody therapy at the Military Medical Academy. A patient was given a fresh plasma transfusion on Wednesday and his temperature was back to normal on Thursday morning. This is the first such case and it is still early to draw conclusions about the long-term effects, said Prof. Ventsislav Moutafchiiski, head of the national coronavirus task force.
Health Minister Kiril Ananiev Wednesday visited the northwestern town of Vidin where 38 out of 360 health workers at the local hospital have tested positive for COVID-19. This is a sign of a serious staff shortage, so there is a plan for staff relocation to the neurology and cardiology departments. The Health Ministry has made a call for staff willing to relocate from other parts of the country.
Regarding the availability of personal protective equipment, Chief Health Inspector Angel Kounchev said that while there is a considerable amount of protective clothing and disinfectants, Sofia's emergency medical service centre alone uses about 100 to 150 suits in 24 hours. RI/DD
