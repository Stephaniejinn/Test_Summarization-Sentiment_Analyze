SATURDAY, May 2 — Customers and employees must wear face coverings inside grocery stores, pharmacies and restaurants until May 29 under an extended statewide executive order issued today.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's new order, like existing measures, requires all customers who can "medically tolerate" face coverings to wear them inside pharmacies and food-selling businesses.
The extension also requires checkout employees to wear some form of covering over their nose and mouth. Businesses must also continue to adopt various social distancing measures and allocate at least two hours per week of shopping time for vulnerable residents and the elderly.
"Michigan has begun flattening the curve, but we must not take our progress for granted and continue taking aggressive action to avoid further spread of this deadly disease," Whitmer said.
The expanded pandemic control measure mirrors an existing state of emergency and other gubernatorial restrictions on bars, restaurants, casinos and theaters that remain in effect through May 28 and a sweeping stay-home order that is set to last through at least May 15.
Under the order, residents still cannot leave their homes except to run critical errands, engage in safe outdoor activities or go to specified essential employment. Whitmer has also announced plans to slowly re-engage the economy. Details are expected to be released in the coming weeks.

The Capital Area Transportation Authority is resuming some bus services on Monday. Any fixed route that typically provides Saturday service — like Route 1 — will operate according to the Saturday schedule throughout the week. Late-night service will remain temporarily unavailable.
Routes 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 46 and 48 do not have Saturday service and will therefore continue to be suspended. Officials also said all campus service, including Route 32, has ended for the summer. All CATA facilities will also remain closed. Visit cata.org for more details and updates.

Whitmer also announced that Michigan has been federally approved to provide housing alternatives — like hotels — for homeless people that need to be quarantined or isolated from COVID-19, also including those who are at high-risk for severe illness from the coronavirus.
State officials will work with local partners to provide additional housing to homeless individuals who test positive and need to be isolated, have been exposed to COVID-19 and need to be quarantined or high-risk individuals that need shelter as a general precautionary measure.
