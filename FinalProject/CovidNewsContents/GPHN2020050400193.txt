Title : L.A. County:Rising COVID-19 deaths push total to more than 4 times entire bad flu season of 2017-18
Ariticle : 
The novel coronavirus continued to spread throughout Los Angeles County this past weekend as officials Sunday announced 21 deaths and 781 new confirmed cases. Saturday saw 38 deaths reported.
A total of 1,229 people have died from the coronavirus in L.A. County since the pandemic began. By comparison, 278 people died during the flu season of 2017-18, a season that hit a five-year high.
The county has confirmed a total of 25,662 positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The majority of confirmed cases represent
people who have recovered, although the department does not keep figures on exactly how many have recovered.
More than 90% of all deaths in the county have come from people with underlying health conditions, and nearly half of all deaths have occurred at nursing homes. Among the deaths reported Sunday, 15 were over the age of 65 and three were 41 to 65 years old. Eleven people had underlying health problems, 10 of whom were over the age of 65.
Two deaths included in Sunday's numbers were reported yesterday by Pasadena and one death by the city of Long Beach. Separately, Long Beach reported another 15 cases and no new deaths Sunday, still with 37 fatalities total and 760 confirmed cases. Pasadena reported on Sunday two deaths and 22 more cases, bringing the number of deaths in the city to 56 and total cases to 439.
"The people lost to COVID-19 are mourned by all of us in L.A. County, and to their loved ones, we wish you peace and healing," said Barbara Ferrer, director of the county Department of Public Health. "We have all worked together in ways that have saved lives and slowed the spread of COVID-19. As we continue to plan for and move into recovery, we will need to continue using the best tools at our disposal, which includes isolating at home if sick, quarantining for 14 days if you're a close contact to a person positive for COVID-19, always physical distancing, wearing cloth face coverings when in contact with others, and washing hands frequently."
As of Sunday, nearly 5,000 people who tested positive have been hospitalized at some point during their illness, representing roughly 20% of positive cases. Close to 2,000 people are currently hospitalized.
Testing capacity continued to increase in L.A. County, with results available for nearly 160,000 people and 14% testing positive. Despite recommendations by county public health officials to continue restricting tests to those who most needed them, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti expanded access to testing last week to anyone who wants one.
Garcetti on Friday said he wanted to see a two-week trend of declining coronavirus-related deaths and hospital admissions before relaxing stay-at-home orders, a gradual process that could last for the remainder of the year. On Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state was "many days, not weeks" away from beginning to reopen. County health officials have said they will soon begin to release plans for a reopening.
This weekend saw a string of demonstrations across Southern California against the emergency health orders that have forced businesses and beaches to close for weeks now.
Meanwhile, new guidance by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest it may take longer for the virus to shed, meaning those who are positive for the virus can infect other people for a longer period of time. Those who tested positive should now self-isolate for at least three days after recovery and at least 10 days have passed since the person experienced the first symptoms.
The California Department of Health on Sunday reported 53,616 confirmed cases and 2,215 fatalities. As of Saturday, 33 deaths statewide have occurred among health care workers, with health departments reporting 5,952 cases among front-line workers.
