Ariticle : 
WELLINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand reported two new confirmed cases of COVID-19, adding number of COVID-19 cases in the country to 1,487, the Ministry of Health said on Sunday.
 Both of Sunday's cases can be linked to a cluster outbreak in an aged care facility in Auckland. Both cases are household contacts of an employee at the rest home.
 The combined total of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand is 1,487, including 1,136 confirmed cases. Currently, there are 1,266 people being recovered from COVID-19, while eight people are in hospital, reported the Ministry of Health in a statement.
 There are 16 significant COVID-19 clusters across New Zealand. However, three of the clusters are considered closed after a total of 28 consecutive days had passed since their most recent report date of a reported case.
 There were 4,634 tests completed on Saturday, with a combined total to date of 150,223 tests in the country.
 New Zealand is now at COVID-19 Alert Level 3. A further review and Alert Level decision will be made on May 11.
 New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield has reinforced the need for people to continue to act in line with the Level 3 expectations. "Sunday's numbers are encouraging but we can't take them for granted. Continuing to be vigilant will be key in supporting a move down to Level 2 as soon as possible," said Bloomfield.
