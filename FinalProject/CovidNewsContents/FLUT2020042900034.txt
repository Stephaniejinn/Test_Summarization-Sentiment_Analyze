							A new 
antibody test
 to check whether someone has been infected with coronavirus which claims to be 99 per cent accurate has been certified for use across Europe.

Global diagnostics specialists Abbot, which has a UK base in Maidenhead, has said it is expecting to have shipped millions of the laboratory based lab tests across Europe by the end of May.

The companyâ€™s diagnostic test has been given a CE Mark certification showing it complies with EU safety rules and can now be used in labs across the UK to test for antibodies created when a person has been infected with 
Covid-19
.

The test identifies the IgG protein the body produces when it has been infected by coronavirus and this can remain in the body for months and possibly years.

In tests Abbot claimed it showed a sensitivity greater than 99 per cent, 14 days after a person developed symptoms.
