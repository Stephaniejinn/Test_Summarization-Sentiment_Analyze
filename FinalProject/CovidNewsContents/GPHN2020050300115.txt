Title : One new COVID-19 case announced in Manitoba
Ariticle : 
The province announced one new case of COVID-19 in Manitoba on Saturday, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable cases to 280.
According to provincial data, six people are in hospital, and none of them is in intensive care. There are currently 38 active cases in Manitoba and 236 individuals have recovered. The number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province remains at six.
The province also announced that an additional 780 laboratory tests were completed on May 1, bringing the total number of lab tests since early February to 26,169.
Manitoba public health officials noted while they've begun to ease restrictions, residents are still advised to remain in or close to their home communities, and the request to stay home as much as possible is still in effect. This includes limiting travel both within the province and in other jurisdictions to essential trips only, heath officials said.
The province also announced that Manitobans in need of childcare as they return to work are now able to access temporary care at a number of approved locations, which can be browsed using the online tool at https://eswchildcare.ca/. From there, families are encouraged to make arrangements by contacting the centre directly.
Licensed childcare centres can provide care for up to 16 children per centre (or per room for larger centres with multiple rooms) while home-based providers may care for up to eight children per centre.
