Original title: Pompeo claims to have &quot;substantial evidence&quot;, exposed by Australian intelligence officials
[Text / Observer Net Xu Qiangang] US Secretary of State Pompeo lied out of a &quot;new height&quot;, and on May 3 again called the &quot;China-made virus theory&quot;, also saying that the United States holds &quot;a lot of evidence&quot;. However, this time Pompeo&#39;s lies cannot even be heard by American intelligence partners. For example, Australia pointed out that the so-called evidence in the United States was based on only a few public news reports, and did not do any intelligence gathering at all.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald on May 4, several senior Australian intelligence officials revealed that a so-called &quot;research document&quot; recently circulated in the International Intelligence Group &quot;Five Eyes Alliance&quot; was mostly based on several claims that &quot;Chinese conceal The public news report of the epidemic. And Australian intelligence officials have hinted that the &quot;evidence&quot; held by the US government may be similar to the content of these news reports.
The &quot;Five Eyes Alliance&quot; is an international intelligence-sharing group composed of the five countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Its origin can be traced back to the &quot;UKUSA&quot; after World War II. Initially, this agreement included only the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1948, Canada was expanded, and in 1956 Australia and New Zealand were included. For more than 70 years, five countries have been monitoring secretly or publicly on a global scale, and have established corresponding facilities. This alliance is still the most complex and oldest intelligence organization.
On May 3, local time, US Secretary of State Pompeo spoke nonsense in an interview with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), claiming that &quot;there is a lot of evidence&quot; that the new coronavirus &quot;from the Wuhan laboratory&quot;, but said nothing about the evidence where is it.
On the other hand, the Australian intelligence agency publicly stated many times at the end of April that at present Australia has not found strong evidence that &quot;the new coronavirus originated from the Wuhan Laboratory. Australian Prime Minister Morrison also said on May 1 that he did not see any &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research in China. He also pointed out that it is only known that the infection case was first discovered in Wuhan, which does not mean that the virus originated in Wuhan because there are other possibilities.
American researchers have also come forward to refute the &quot;Made in China virus&quot;, Professor Jonathan Mazet, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and an expert in epidemiology and disease ecology, worked with researchers in the Wuhan P4 laboratory including Shi Zhengli . She told Business Insider on May 2 that the two sides have worked together to develop very strict safety standards, &quot;It is extremely unlikely that a laboratory accident will leak,&quot; and gives four reasons.
Pompeio&#39;s recent frequent open mouths have been criticized by the news network for several days. On May 4th, the news broadcasted CCTV International&#39;s sharp comments, accusing Pompeo and other American politicians of swindling, anti-intelligence and anti-science. Behind this scene of politics and porcelain farce, there is a sinister plot.
