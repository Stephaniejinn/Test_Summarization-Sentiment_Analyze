Original title: &quot;China is not a new crown virus associate!&quot; Russian congressmen approve of Western media hype &quot;Five Eyes Alliance Report&quot;: politicized anti-China operations!
[Global Network Comprehensive Report] Australia ’s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed in a report on the 2nd that the media obtained an investigation report from the &quot;Five Eyes Alliance&quot; showing that &quot;China deliberately concealed the information on the new coronary pneumonia epidemic&quot; and accused China of &quot;damaging&quot; International Transparency &quot;. After the report was released, some Western media continued to follow the hype. In this regard, according to the Russian Satellite Network, the Russian State Duma International Affairs Committee Chairman Slutsky said on the 3rd that Western media reports that &quot;China conceals the real data of New Coronary Pneumonia&quot; are &quot;politicized anti-China operations.&quot; Slutsky also said that China is not a &quot;colleague&quot; of the new crown virus, but the first country to suffer losses due to the new crown epidemic. The claims that &quot;the virus originated in the laboratory&quot; are all speculations.
The &quot;Five Eyes Alliance&quot; is composed of intelligence agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Australia&#39;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that they obtained a total of 15 pages of investigation reports. The document claimed that research showed that the new coronavirus &quot;may be derived from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute.&quot; The report also accused China of &quot;covering up news about the outbreak and destroying laboratory data&quot; and &quot;denying that the virus exists from person to person.&quot; The report also lists a timeline for China&#39;s response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, accusing China of inappropriate response to the epidemic. The US Fox News website said on the 3rd that US intelligence has not confirmed that the report actually exists.
In response to the above report, the satellite network said that Russian Congressman Slutsky believes: &quot;The Western media&#39;s report on the results of the &#39;Five Eyes Alliance&#39; investigation is a politicized anti-China operation initiated by the West.&quot; They are now openly cooperating with the international community to provide not only information but also medical assistance. &quot;
Slutsky also emphasized that China is not a &quot;colleague&quot; of the new crown virus. China is the first country to suffer losses due to the new crown epidemic. Those claims about &quot;the virus originated in the laboratory&quot; are all speculations. Slutsky said that (all countries) can overcome the new crown epidemic only by joining hands, rather than blaming and intensifying contradictions.
In fact, before some Western media and politicians “spilled dirty water” on China, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs detailed the timeline on several occasions. Since the end of December last year, China has timely released epidemic information, shared prevention and control experience, and promoted The main facts of international cooperation in epidemic prevention and control. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has stated on many occasions that China has always maintained an open, transparent and responsible attitude on the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic. The Chinese side reported the epidemic situation to WHO as soon as possible, shared the gene sequence of the new coronavirus with other countries in the world at the first time, and cooperated with the international community to prevent and control the epidemic.
