Title : Victory: Canberra now coronavirus free
Ariticle : 
For the first time since March 12, Canberra has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, becoming the first Australian jurisdiction to be rid of the virus.
Over the past seven weeks, the ACT saw three tragic deaths as a result of the virus, and continues to be subject to clampdowns on virtually all aspects of daily life.
In total, 106 ACT residents tested positive for the disease.
News that the final two people infected with the virus had recovered came with little fanfare, in a daily government release detailing the number of new cases, active cases and people recovered.
In total 8336 people tested negative to the virus, and on Thursday, before confirming there were no known cases, the ACT government announced that anyone with a sore throat, fever, cough or shortness of breath could be tested for the virus.
ACT Chief Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said news that there was no longer anyone known to be suffering from the virus was the culmination of weeks of strict controls on daily life in the Territory.
“It’s vitally important that we continue testing as many people as possible to know the most accurate representation of COVID-19 within the ACT community,” Dr Coleman said.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Thursday also announced a series of infrastructure projects designed to boost the local economy.
The Northern Territory — which has a population just over half the ACT’s — is also expected to have no known active cases within days, having acted early to introduce the strictest border controls in the country.
