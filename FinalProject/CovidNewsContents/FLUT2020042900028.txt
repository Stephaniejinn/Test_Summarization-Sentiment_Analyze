Doctors report uptick in surprising coronavirus complication: dangerous blood clots

Blood clots are not usually associated with respiratory viruses.

Coronavirus causes blood clots and sudden strokes in young, healthy patients, doctors warn


Why are so many COVID-19 patients also seeing blood clots?


https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-...ry?id=70131612

Health experts have been confounded by this latest trend.


https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/...ronavirus-tpa/
Doctors treating the sickest 
Covid-19
 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.

A number of doctors are now trying to blast those clots with tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, an antithrombotic drug typically reserved for treating strokes and heart attacks. Other doctors are eyeing the blood thinner heparin as a potential way to prevent clotting before it starts.

Without a rigorous study, though, it’s impossible to know the potential risks or benefits of tPA, blood thinners, or other drugs — or what makes a difference. Until more robust research gets underway, the body of evidence now is a handful of case reports and anecdotal observations on the use of drugs to combat clots.

	Clots are probably added to by silent hypoxia from collapsed sacks and its a spiral down from there.

 Very interesting article on guidelines for nutrition for patients with coronavirus. From Chinese Journal of Clinical Medicine. Is it a chicken and egg thing here - with a problem with Protein S deficiency leading to thrombosis - and how is Protein S - Vitamin K dependent? Seems counterintuitive - but in the list of medicines and nutritional supplements in this article - they recommend vitamin k supplements!

	It has also been bugging me - almost every photo of patients in China have an IV attached - and yet in Italy in the quarantine areas there are lots of people on army cots who do not even seem to have a jug of water to hand. Also here (UK) if people are in self isolation because they are symptomatic they will certainly not be popping in their own IV. Is there clinical evidence from China showing the IV helped? For certain hydration and fluid intake is always important with Pneumonia. Did the Chinese practitioners add anything to the IV's? Has anyone else any input?

	I also never saw any compression socks on patients in Chinese hospitals - and yet very early on the Italian hospitals were using compression socks...

													
																							
Nutritional supplements recommended by Clinical Nutrition Branch of Chinese Nutrition Society

Very interesting and thorough list of supplements and vitamins recommended for patients with varying conditions. Also tables with different recommendations for different ages, including babies and the elderly.

...

	
		
			
							
The new crown critically ill patients often significant systemic inflammation of the body in a high catabolic state 
[ 
. 1
 - 
. 3
 ]
 . Due to the release of various stress-related hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines and insufficient oxygen supply, its nutritional metabolic characteristics are mainly manifested as: (1) Decreased energy supply for glucose oxidation, increased glycolysis, enhanced gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance , Increased blood sugar; (2) increased protein breakdown, increased protein synthesis during the acute phase, decreased muscle protein synthesis, and altered amino acid profile: such as a decrease in the concentration of branched chain amino acids (BCAA); (3) increased fat mobilization and breakdown; (4) multiple Increased consumption of vitamins and trace elements. In this case, patients are prone to malnutrition, and the incidence of malnutrition is higher for patients with chronic underlying diseases.
					
	

....


	
		
			
							
2.1.3 Fat
The target amount of fat: It is recommended that the total fat supply ratio of diet and tube feeding nutrition reach 25% ~ 30% of the total energy 
[ 
12
 ]
 . For critically ill patients with parenteral nutrition, due to changes in fat absorption and metabolism, intravenous injection of too high fat will lead to lipid overload and toxicity, leading to hypertriglyceridemia and abnormal liver function, while low plasma three Acylglycerol concentration levels are associated with improved survival 
[ 
6
 ]
 . Therefore, it is recommended that the daily venous fat is 1 g / kg, at most not more than 1.5 g / kg, and the dose needs to be adjusted according to individual tolerance 
[ 
6
 ]
 .
					
	

.....

	
		
			
							
2.1.5 Liquid volume
Follow the general principles of fluid therapy, that is, stabilize patients with 30 to 40 mL / kg per day. In critically ill patients, the minimum amount of fluid that meets the needs of major nutrients is within our means. For every 1 ° C increase in body temperature, supplement 3 ~ 5 mL / kg (calculated at 4 mL / kg) 
[ 
8
 ]
 . Patients with critically ill neonates often have pulmonary edema, fluid accumulation, etc. While maintaining fluid balance, it is more necessary to prevent excessive fluid, especially intravenous infusion 
[

 ]
 .

2.2.3 Enteral nutrition (EN)
EN contraindications: comprising shock uncontrolled, uncontrolled acidosis and hypoxemia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal ischemia, obstruction, abdominal compartment syndrome and distant-feeding path high output fistula 
[ 
6
 , 
19
 ]
 . In addition, when hemodynamic instability or gastric retention is greater than 500 mL / 6 h, EN should be suspended 
[ 
5
 ]
 .

Indications for EN: enteral nutrition can maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier and function 
[ 
19
 ]
 , prevent gastrointestinal complications in patients with mechanical ventilation 
[ 
13
 , 
19
 ]
 , and promote intestinal immune function 
[ 
13
 , 
20
 ]
 . So, who can not eat by mouth and no contraindications EN new crown critically ill patients, should be preferred EN, EN given early in the ~ 48 H 24- 
[ 
5
 - 
6
 , 
19
 , 
21
 ]
 . For patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), early EN is also recommended 
[ 
22
 ]
 .

Nourishing feeding of EN: Nourishing feeding (usually defined as 10-20 mL / h or 10-20 kcal / h) can prevent intestinal mucosa atrophy and maintain intestinal integrity 
[ 
13
 ]
 . Therefore, it is recommended that in the case of critically ill patients with new crowns, EN cannot be increased due to gastrointestinal intolerance or other reasons. If the situation permits, it is recommended not to stop EN completely, and try to maintain nourishing EN feeding to keep the intestinal mucosa intact.
