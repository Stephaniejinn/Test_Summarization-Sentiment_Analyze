Title : B.C. health officials to release new COVID-19 modelling figures today
Ariticle : 
VICTORIA — The British Columbia government is expected to release new modelling data for COVID-19 today, as the province also prepares to begin reopening the economy.
Dr. Bonnie Henry said Saturday that B.C. is not entering a new phase of spread or containment but the government will provide more details about whom the virus is affecting.
At least 2,171 British Columbians have been infected with COVID-19, including 114 who have died and 1,376 who have fully recovered.
British Columbia hasn’t released its reopening plan, however Premier John Horgan is promising details this week.
Henry says officials will not open different sectors until they are sure those sectors have a workable plan to make sure protections are in place.
She says outbreaks at three poultry plants act as a cautionary tale about the importance of workplace safety measures and ensuring physical distance at work.
“That tells us we need to make sure we have the right safety measures in place in each area of our economy to make sure we can all be comforted and understand that we are opening up safely and slowly and methodically,” Henry said.
