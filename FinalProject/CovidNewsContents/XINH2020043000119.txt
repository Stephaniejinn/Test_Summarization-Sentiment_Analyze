MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia is facing a greater challenge from the coronavirus pandemic, as the number of accumulated cases in the country reached 106,498 on Thursday, with a daily record tally of 7,099.
Russia now ranks as the world's eighth worst-hit country by COVID-19 in terms of infections, though its fatality rate remains low with a current death toll of 1,073 and 11,619 recoveries, according to the country's coronavirus response center.
Moscow, the country's epicenter and most populous city, has confirmed 3,093 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking its total to 53,739.
However, the Moscow-to-nation ratio has been declining, indicating that smaller cities in Russia are facing rising risks.
Official data showed that 208,236 were under medical observation nationwide as of Wednesday.
The situation is very tense and Russia is in the most difficult stage of the fight against the epidemic, President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday at a meeting with senior officials and regional heads.
BATTLE AGAINST DISEASE
On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry commissioned six multifunctional medical centers for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Two others have already entered operation and another eight will be completed by May 15.
The Russian government has earmarked 8.8 billion rubles (120 million U.S. dollars) to build these 16 medical centers, which will be able to accommodate a total of 1,600 patients.

Russia has concentrated and mobilized its industrial resources to produce medical and personal protective equipment.
According to Putin, the country produced over 800 ventilators in April and will produce 2,500 more in May, up from less than 70 at the beginning of the year. Mask production has surged more than 10 times, from 800,000 per day early this year to 8.5 million in April.
All citizens, except those working for essential institutions and establishments, are on paid leave from March 30 till May 11 as part of the country's efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
People are only allowed to go out to receive medical care, travel to work, shop at the nearest store or pharmacy, or walk a pet.

A 10-member Chinese medical team carried out work in Russia on April 11-18, sharing experience with the Russian side and offering training for medics on the prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
SUPPORT FOR VULNERABLE
The Russian central bank last week expected the country's gross domestic product to decrease by 4-6 percent this year due to virus-related restrictions.
The bank cut its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent, the lowest since September 2013, to "support lending, including in the most vulnerable economic sectors."

COVID-19 has forced Russians to cut their consumption of goods and services by 90 percent, results of a recent survey showed.
Earlier this week, Putin signed a decree allocating 200 billion rubles to support individuals and companies. Russia has already rolled out tax breaks for small and medium-sized enterprises and allowances for families with young children.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that the government may introduce a new package of measures to bolster the economy.
