The economy may not be the top issue for Canadians facing down the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is a growing one for a significant section of the population. The latest DART & Mara/Blue Voice Canada poll paints a portrait of a worried Canada.
A strong majority, 57%, now say they are stressed, or concerned about money and finances with the country ranging from a high of 67% saying they are stressed in Alberta to a low of 45% in Atlantic Canada.
“The stress is felt virtually equally for those who are younger and middle-aged Canadians, with those who are older being less stressed but notably concerned,” pollster John Wright said.
As for being able to pay the bills, 40% say they are “worried about being able to pay their bills (including rent or mortgage) if the COVID-19 pandemic situation keeps up much longer.”
Business owners are most concerned about being able to pay the bills with 59% saying the worries keep them up at night compared to just 26% of employees or retirees aged 55 and over who say being able to pay the bills is a worry.
As for when, or if, things will start to get back to normal, three-quarters of Canadians “believe that life will not be the same after the virus.”
The DART & Maru/Blue Voice Canada Poll was conducted among 1,530 randomly selected Canadian adults who are members of Maru/Blue’s online panel on April 26, 2020 and is considered accurate to within +/- 2.9 percentage points.
