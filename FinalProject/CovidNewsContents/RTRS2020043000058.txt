Ariticle : 
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could miss its target of carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, Justice Minister Robert Buckland said on Thursday.  
Some 52,429 tests were carried out on Wednesday, according to the latest figures, putting Britain on course to miss the target set by the health minister. 
“Even if it isn’t met, we are well on our way to ramping this up,” Buckland told BBC television.
