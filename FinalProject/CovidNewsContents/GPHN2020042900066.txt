Title : ELECTIVE SURGERIES TO RESUME WITH GUIDELINES 6 NEW NURSING HOME DEATHS IN ALLEGHENY
Ariticle : 
In a sign of increasing comfort with the gradual reopening of parts of the economy, the state health department will allow hospitals to resume elective surgeries and procedures under new guidelines, Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine announced Monday.
Meanwhile, Pennsylvania reported 885 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 42,050. The statewide death toll rose to 1,597, an increase of 47 fatalities over the day before. Allegheny County's case count rose 13 to 1,224, and its death count rose by six to 79 - all of which, according to the state's figures, were in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Westmoreland's coroner added three deaths to that county's total, taking it to 30.
The new elective procedure guidelines are in line with those released by the American Hospital Association, American College of Surgeons and other health care industry groups, Dr. Levine said. They dictate that elective procedures can only resume if they will not "jeopardize the safety of patients and staff."
"We know many Pennsylvanians have had to delay important elective procedures and operations," Dr. Levine said, "but it was necessary to ensure that our health care system had enough capacity in case it became overwhelmed with patients with COVID-19."
The guidelines recommend that facilities ensure that they have enough personal protective equipment stockpiled and trained staff to manage a "surge" in COVID-19 cases. Facilities should also not have to resort to "crisis standards of care" in the event of a surge.
"We've been working very closely with our hospital partners to safely ensure that Pennsylvanians who need treatment not related to COVID-19 can get it," Dr. Levine said.
Allegheny Health Network said in an email statement that it will begin a "careful and structured" move toward restarting elective and "medically urgent" procedures this week.
"We will continue to be mindful of the pandemic's evolving impact on our region, however, and will always make the safety of our patients and caregivers the highest priority as we return to a more normalized surgical schedule," the statement said.
UPMC, the state's largest hospital system, was already planning to restart elective surgeries, with the goal of reaching pre-pandemic capacity by the end of May. The Post-Gazette obtained documents earlier this month showing hospital leadership offering guidance on how to justify the procedures, recommending the use of terms such as "urgent," "cancer," "unstable" and "relief from suffering" in reports.
After the news conference, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) released an email statement praising the decision by the health department.
"HAP and its members look forward to continuing to work together with the Wolf Administration," the statement read, "to ensure we are achieving the right balance between reducing COVID-19's incidence and expanding access for Pennsylvania patients to essential health care services, including non-emergent surgeries and procedures."
The decision has the potential to help the state better track the spread of the novel coronavirus. Dr. Levine said that hospitals would be asked to test anyone who schedules an elective procedure.
"All of that data will be really, really useful for us," she said.
Dr. Levine said that 47% of hospital beds, 40% of intensive care beds, and 70% of ventilators are still available across the state, though the harder-hit eastern part of the state has less excess capacity.
Despite the state's cautious moves toward reopening - golf courses, marinas, and some campgrounds will also be allowed to reopen under social distancing guidelines starting May 1, the governor's office announced Monday - on the whole, much of the economy remains in a state of limbo.
The governor's reopening plan sets a target threshold: a region must not see more than 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days. However, Dr. Levine emphasized that the health department would be making reopening decisions based on a variety of factors, and not simply the numerical threshold.
"We're going to be looking at that metric, and we're going to be looking at many other things," Dr. Levine said, noting that regions should also ensure they have sufficient testing, contact tracing, and hospital capacity to slow or stop future outbreaks. The department will also use models from Carnegie Mellon University.
"Things could be quicker, but we want to be accurate," Dr. Levine said. She said that the state is doing "somewhat better" in acquiring swabs and reagent chemicals for increasing testing capacity.
She also said that the state is considering requests by various counties to be classified in other regions for the purposes of reopening, including one by Cambria County to be separated from the southwestern region and reopened on its own.
Both the state and Allegheny County have seen somewhat encouraging numbers in recent days. Monday marked Pennsylvania's third day in a row with less than 50 reported deaths from COVID-19, and Allegheny saw zero new deaths on Sunday.
With the exception of Westmoreland County, where its coroner reported three new deaths, there were no other fatalities blamed on COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania reported Monday.
Allegheny County's total cases to date include 1,190 confirmed and 34 probable, according to the county health department. A case is probable "when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves," according to a statement accompanying the numbers.
Among those who have died in Allegheny County, 72 are confirmed and seven were probable.
Of the 1,224 cases in Allegheny County, 169 of them - or 14% of the total number of cases - have been healthcare workers, the county said. There are 213 past or present hospitalizations; 2,394 of the statewide cases are in healthcare workers, roughly 6%, and the state has seen 2,799 total hospitalizations.
