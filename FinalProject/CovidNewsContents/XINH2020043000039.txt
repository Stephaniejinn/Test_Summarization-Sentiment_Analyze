The 19 sectors of Brazilian industry analyzed showed a decreased level of confidence.
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Industry Confidence Index hit in April its lowest level since the index was created in January 2001, falling 39.3 points to 58.2 due to fear generated by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study released on Wednesday.
"The result of the April industry survey expresses the harmful effects of the crisis caused by COVID-19 on the sector," stated the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). The organization warned that in the coming months, the indicator "may generate new negative surprises if the level of uncertainty remains high. "
The 19 sectors of Brazilian industry analyzed showed a decreased level of confidence, with the Current Situation Index falling 31.4 points to 67.4, and the Expectations Index falling 46.6 points to 49.6, the lowest levels ever recorded.
The proportion of Brazilian companies that consider the current economic situation to be poor almost tripled, jumping from 21.4 percent in March to 59.9 percent in April.
The decrease in expectations was motivated by the forecast for production for the next three months. In March, 22.5 percent of Brazilian companies forecast lower production for the next 90 days, while in April the proportion rose to 71.6 percent.
Similarly, those expecting higher production in the next three months fell from 33.3 percent in March, to 6.6 percent in April.
The level of capacity utilization fell 18 percentage points to 57.3 percent, the largest decrease and the lowest level recorded since measurements first began to be taken.
