ULAN BATOR, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia received medical supplies from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Tuesday in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.
The medical materials included 100,000 masks, 1,000 protective suits and 200 boxes of testing kits.
"As a result of the Mongolian government's optimal measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Mongolia has become one of the few countries where no cases of the coronavirus from local transmission has been reported. This is a great achievement," Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Chai Wenrui said in a speech during the handover ceremony of the donation.
"In addition, no cases of COVID-19 infection imported from China has been reported in Mongolia. We are ready to cooperate with the Mongolian side to maintain the situation," Chai said.
Mongolian Health Minister Davaajantsan Sarangerel expressed her deep gratitude to the Chinese government and people for the donation.
As of Tuesday, a total of 38 COVID-19 cases have been reported in Mongolia.
All confirmed cases, including four non-nationals, are imported, according to the country's National Center for Communicable Disease.
