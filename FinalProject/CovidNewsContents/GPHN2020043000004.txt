Public Health Sudbury & Districts has confirmed that an outbreak has been declared at Extendicare York long-term care home in Sudbury. 
Ministry direction requires a COVID-19 outbreak be declared with a single laboratory-confirmed case in a resident or staff member. 
In this case, one staff member tested positive and is under active follow up with Public Health Sudbury & Districts. The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 stands at 58 in Public Health’s service area.
Public Health Sudbury & Districts is working closely with Extendicare York to ensure all measures are in place to protect staff and residents, said a press release from the health unit. The risk of infection in the long-term care home remains low. 
None of the residents who were in contact with this employee is symptomatic. Public Health Sudbury & Districts continues to work with all long-term care homes to test staff and residents as part of the previously announced surveillance testing in long-term care homes.
“Our staff are working with the facility and are actively following up with the individual to provide important public health direction, explore possible exposure settings, and identify any close contacts to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus,” said Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, Medical Officer of Health with Public Health Sudbury & Districts, in the press release.
