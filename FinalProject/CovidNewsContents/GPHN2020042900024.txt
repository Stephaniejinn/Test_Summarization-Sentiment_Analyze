Title : COVID-19: Food trucks allowed to set up at B.C. truck stops during pandemic
Ariticle : 
The B.C. government is allowing commercial food trucks to operate at provincially owned locations across B.C. to support commercial truck drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government says it is forgoing usual restrictions and fees for food-truck operators who are willing to set up at rest areas, weigh scales and other commercial truck pullouts.
With the closure of restaurants due to physical-distancing restrictions, the B.C. Trucking Association says drivers have been having an increasingly difficult time accessing food, restrooms, and other resources while on the road.
For that reason, the BCTA established the Meals For Truck Drivers initiative with business owners to mobilize the food truck industry to bring meals, along with portable wash facilities, to locations in need around the province.
“Commercial truck drivers play an important role in maintaining the supply chain by delivering essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers ensure people around the province continue to have access to the items they need, including food and medicine. For these reasons, the ministry is working in collaboration with private food truck operators in order to help provide more options for truck drivers on their routes,” the Ministry of Transportation and Highways said in a statement.
Current food truck locations include the Nordel CVSE inspection station in Delta, Zopkios brake check on Highway 5, Britton Creek rest area on Highway 5 and the Kamloops weigh scale.
Along with allowing food trucks, the province has also installed more than 25 portable toilets at commercial pullouts and inspection stations.
