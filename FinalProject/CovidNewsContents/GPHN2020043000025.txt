Title : Minnesota's coronavirus case count jumps as testing ramps up
Ariticle : 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Department of Health reported another big jump in coronavirus cases Wednesday as the state ramps up its testing capacity.
The agency said 463 more Minnesotans have tested positive — a new one-day high — to raise the state's total to 4,644. That total includes 138 new cases in Nobles County of southwestern Minnesota, where the big JBS pork plant in Worthington had to shut down because of the outbreak.
State and private labs combined to complete 2,915 new tests, also a new daily high. Gov. Tim Walz last week announced a partnership with the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic to expand the state's testing capacity to 20,000 per day. Vice President Mike Pence visited Mayo on Tuesday to learn more. Officials have warned that the confirmed case count will swell as testing accelerates.
Minnesota also reported 18 new deaths Wednesday to raise the state's total to 319.
Health officials say the real number of Minnesotans infected with the coronavirus is likely much higher because most people don’t get tested, and studies suggest that people can be infected without feeling sick.
The department said 320 patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, up six from Tuesday, including 119 patients in intensive care, one fewer than Tuesday.
