Single-site staffing restrictions at PCHs taking effect
Beginning Friday, staff working in personal care homes will have to work at a single site under new Public Health orders.
The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.
Of the 127 licensed PCHs in Manitoba, 121 have confirmed readiness, with work ongoing to address staffing issues at the remaining sites by the weekend.
New testing site in Swan River
A new drive-thru community testing site will open Friday in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation will be daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.
