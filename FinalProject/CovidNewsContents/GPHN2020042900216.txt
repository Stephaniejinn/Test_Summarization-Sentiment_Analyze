Title : Ross County reports 36 COVID-19 cases
Ariticle : 
CHILLICOTHE – The Ross County Health District is reporting 36 cases of coronavirus in the county as of Tuesday afternoon.
This includes 35 confirmed cases and one listed as probable, with eight hospitalized and one dead.
The reported cases are for Ross County residents only. Not all confirmed cases were tested at Adena Health System, and Adena may have additional confirmed cases that are not Ross County residents as they serve a multi-county region.
Twenty-one cases are listed as suspected (awaiting test results).
Patients range in age from 19-80. Eleven have recovered.
Three inmates at CCI have been confirmed positive for coronavirus, with five in isolation.
Neighboring Vinton County — the last county in Ohio to report a positive case — has its first cases with three reported as of Tuesday.
Pickaway County the largest amount of cases at 1,706, but most of those cases come from the prison there.
A nurse at Pickaway Correctional Institution died Sunday night after being diagnosed with COVID-19 as the outbreak spreads through Ohio prisons.
According to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, Tina Reeves, 58, of Blacklick who worked at Pickaway since 2006, was the second prisons' employee to die during the coronavirus pandemic. No additional information about Reeves was immediately available.
John Dawson, a corrections officer at Marion Correctional Institution died April 8. Dawson, 55, of Mansfield, had worked at the prison since 1996.
The Marion and Pickaway prisons have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 as the virus rips through Ohio's penal institutions. A compilation of cases by the New York Times found Marion and Pickaway the top two hot spots in the nation for the coronavirus.
