Title : In the United States, the authorities approved the use of the antiviral medicine remdesivir in patients with coronavirus*** TRANSLATED ***

Recovery medicine should only be given to seriously ill people.
In the United States, the authorities have decided to allow the use of the antiviral medicine remdesivir in the treatment of coronavirus-induced covid-19 disease in severely ill patients. President Donald Trump spoke on the matter.
With the decision, remdesivir can now be given to people who are in hospital and whose condition is serious. According to the US authorities, a patient's condition is defined as severe if the oxygen level in the blood is low or if the patient needs oxygen therapy or is in a ventilator.
American Gilead Sciences Remdesivir was originally developed by the company as a medicine for ebola. In clinical trials, covid-19-treated patients have now been shown to recover approximately 30 percent faster than placebo-treated controls.
No significant effect on mortality has been observed. The experiments involved more than a thousand people in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
The injectable drug is suitable for both adults and children.
The company promised to donate 1.5 million doses of the drug
Daniel O’Day, CEO of Gilead Sciences, has said the company will donate 1.5 million doses of the drug in its stock and will continue to sell the product at an “affordable” price. The dose of the medicine in stock is said to be sufficient for about 140,000 treatment periods of ten days.
Remdesivir does not affect the strong immune defense reactions triggered by the coronavirus in the patient, but directly to the virus itself and its multiplication.
The testing was led by the US Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID). Its director, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, described the test results of remdesivir on Thursday, saying that while the results were clearly positive in a statistically significant sense, they were still modest.
However, according to Fauc, tests can provide direction for the search for a more effective treatment.
Likewise, viral hemorrhagic fever to Ebola from remdesivir was ultimately not an effective drug.
