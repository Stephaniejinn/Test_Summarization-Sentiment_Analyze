Title : Botswana: Border Jumpers May Hinder Govt Efforts
Ariticle : 
Kanye â€” Escalating number of border jumpers along the Molopo river is a cause for concern and a hindrance to government's fight against spread of COVID-19.
In an interview, Southern District commissioner, Mr Mmoloki Raletobana, said since the outbreak of COVID-19, they experienced a challenge of people entering the country through ungazetted points, thereby posing a health risk.
He said a total of 32 Batswana were now in mandatory quarantine after they were caught on various dates for illegally crossing into Botswana. They were accommodated at various facilities in Ramatlabama, Metlojane, Good Hope and Pitsane Photlokwe.
He said two people,who were arrested on Monday night, said they got an opportunity after South Africa eased its travel restrictions recently. Mr Raletobana said some were visiting families and shopping, while others were bringing their livestock from the South African side.
He noted that the absence of a physical fence at the border made it easy for people to move across the two countries.
Consequently, Mr Raletobana noted that the Southern District COVID-19 command centre would make recommendations for construction of a fence along the border to control movement of people.
On other issues, he noted that there were 25 people on home quarantine in Moshupa and Mogonye who were identified through the ongoing contact tracing exercise.
