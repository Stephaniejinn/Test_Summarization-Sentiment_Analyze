The Massachusetts Department of Health reported an additional 2106 COVID-19 cases today, bringing the total in the state to 64,311.
The City of Boston has reported more than 9500 cases and 410 deaths.
Statewide, an additional 154 deaths were reported today, bringing the cumulative death toll to 3716.
Today, the administration of Governor Charlie Baker issued an order requiring the use of masks or face coverings in public places where they cannot socially distance from others.
All residents over the age of two are ordered to use a face covering or mask in public places where maintaining proper social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are not possible.
The order applies to all workers and customers of businesses and other organizations that are currently open to the public and permitted to operate as COVID-19 Essential Businesses, such as grocery stores, pharmacies and other retail stores. Residents are also required to wear a mask or face covering at all times when using any means of transportation service or public mass transit.
The order today follows the extension by the Baker administration of non-essential business closures to May 18th. Governor Charlie Baker announced that the Department of Public Health’s stay-at-home advisory will remain in effect.
Earlier this week, Governor Baker announced the formation of the Reopening Advisory Board, which will be Co-Chaired by Lt. Governor Karyn Polito and Housing and Economic Development Secretary Mike Kennealy.
