The mounting infections across the U.S. come as the death toll exceeded 57,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
New York remains the worst hit state in the country, with 291,996 confirmed cases and 22,668 deaths as of Tuesday, followed by 111,188 cases and 6,044 deaths in New Jersey.
Infections in the U.S. far exceed all other nations, with Spain recording 229,422 cases and Italy on the cusp of surpassing 200,000.
The U.S. now makes up one-third of global infections since the virus first emerged in the southern Chinese city of Wuhan last December.

Nearly all nations in the world have implemented lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, sending  economies  into free fall.
Demonstrators  have amassed around the U.S. this month to protest  what many see as violations of state and U.S. constitutions following weeks of imposed social distancing restrictions that have shuttered businesses, effectively pausing the economy and hurting the livelihoods of many Americans.
Several states have begun relaxing restrictions to gradually reopen closed businesses in the hopes of reviving their economies.
However, some political leaders and health officials have warned that easing measures too soon could lead to a new surge of COVID-19 cases.
