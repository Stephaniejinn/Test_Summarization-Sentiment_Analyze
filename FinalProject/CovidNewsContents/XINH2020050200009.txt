"As a result of the close cooperation between the two governments, an air bridge was established between Hungary and China that allows the unimpeded flow of medical equipment needed to combat the virus successfully," said Kovacs.
Commenting on China's efforts in fighting the COVID-19, the Hungarian official said that the Chinese government had taken strict quarantine measures, and the situation in China was improving steadily. Meanwhile, Chinese experts shared their experiences and good practices on COVID-19 prevention, and Chinese factories provided the supply of medical equipment and tools to the world.
