							Hospitals in
 New York City 
have reported that they are treating 15 children that have shown symptoms often associated with 
Kawasaki disease,
 which global health officials have linked to the coronavirus.


...

The New York Times
 reported
 early Tuesday that the children range from 2 to 15.  Their illnesses have been described in a bulletin as a multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially linked to COVID-19.

Last week, 
Matt Hancock
, the U.K.â€™s health secretary, issued a warning that some children have died in Italy and Britain from an unknown condition that has been likened to Kawasaki disease. Doctors in Europe said some of the children who died from the inflammatory ailment had no underlying conditions.

The Times pointed out that none of the children in the U.S. died.
