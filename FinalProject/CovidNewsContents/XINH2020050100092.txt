Figures from the Africa CDC also showed that amid the rapid spread of the virus across the continent, the highly COVID-19 affected African countries include Egypt, South Africa, Morocco as well as Algeria.
The Africa CDC disclosed that the Northern African region is the most affected area across the continent both in terms of the number of positive COVID-19 cases, as well as the number of deaths.
