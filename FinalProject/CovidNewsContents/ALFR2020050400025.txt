"I am saddened to inform you that we have lost two more patients from Mombasa," Aman said on Sunday, when he issued an update on the situation in the country.
COVID-19 infections in the country now stand at 465, after 30 more people tested positive of the virus.
The cases new cases are from Mombasa, Nairobi, Bungoma and Kitui.

The government has lately intensifed mass testing in targetted areas, including on truck drivers traversing the country to or from neighbouring East African countries.
By Sunday, there was a low turn out of people willing to undertake the test.
"We are appealing to Kenyans in targeted areas such as Kawangware to come forward to be tested, if we want to flatten the curve," Aman.
