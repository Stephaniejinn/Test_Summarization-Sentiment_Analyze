Title : Doc's wary over lifting lockdown
Ariticle : 
CHIEF Medical officer Tony Holohan says he doesn't anticipate advising the Government to lift lockdown restrictions tomorrow. Dr Holohan made the comments during last night's press briefing as health officials announced a further 31 people were killed by the virus bringing the death toll to 1,190. A further 376 were diagnosed with the deadly bug meaning there are now 20,253 confirmed Coronavirus cases in the country. The Government is expected to make a statement regarding lockdown restrictions, based on recommendations from NPHET, tomorrow.
But Dr Holohan revealed "we haven't got to a point" where we've seen the required drop in the number of confirmed cases. He said: "We estimate that, as of Saturday 25, 12,222 Covid cases in the community have recovered. Some 1,164 cases have been discharged from hospital which gives us a recovery rate of 70 per cent."
Dr Kathleen MacLellan, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Chair of NPHET Vulnerable People Subgroup, said: "Ireland's one of the few countries who has collected and officially reported data from long-term residential care settings from the start of the pandemic. From the end of March, we've seen an increase in deaths in this sector that can be attributed to Covid-19."
Officials revealed that out of 392 clusters in community residential settings, 219 were in nursing homes.
