Title : Kenya: EPRA Donates Sh10 Million Towards COVID-19 Kitty
Ariticle : 
Nairobi â€” The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has donated Sh10 Million to the Kenya COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund.
The contribution follows the government's appeal to both individuals and corporates in the country to assist in the fight against the virus through donations to the Fund.
The COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund was set up by President Uhuru Kenyatta to spearhead mobilization of resources for emergency response towards containing the spread and impact of the coronavirus.
Donations channeled to the Fund will be utilized to support the government's efforts in the supply of medical facilities and equipment and support for vulnerable communities.
"As a corporate citizen, we are delighted to contribute to our individual and collective effort as a nation in eradicating this pandemic. I believe that the Authority's contribution will bolster the Government's efforts in fighting the virus and will go a long way in ensuring necessities such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are provided to our health workers and food donations made to families and individuals who have been hit the hardest by the virus." Said Pavel Oimeke, EPRA's Director-General.
Early this month the Authority commenced online issuance of licenses as a measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus by minimizing social interactions with customers while ensuring uninterrupted provision of services.
