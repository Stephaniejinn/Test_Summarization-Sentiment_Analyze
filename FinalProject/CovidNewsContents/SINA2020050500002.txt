Original title: Dissatisfied with the speed of opening &quot;not fast enough&quot;, Trump named Tucao Virginia and encouraged people to &quot;go to the park, go to the beach&quot; ...
[Global Network Reporter Zhang Xiaoya] According to the US Fox News report, on May 3 local time, US President Trump criticized some US states for reopening (economy) not fast enough in an interview with the Fox News &quot;City Hall&quot; Among them, he named &quot;Tucao&quot; Virginia, and encouraged residents of the state &quot;can go to the park&quot;, &quot;can go to the beach&quot;.
The report said that on the show, Trump was invited to answer questions raised by Fox News viewers.
A female audience member asked in the video, &quot;What agreements will the federal government make for the detection of new coronavirus?&quot;
&quot;It depends on where you come from,&quot; Trump replied. He admitted that some states hit harder by the epidemic, such as New York, will take longer to reopen (economic), but he hopes some other states &quot;can Hurry up. &quot;
&quot;In many other states, really, the situation is not too bad. (Although) this is always bad-they lost a lot of people, which is very bad. There are many people killed in each state. Whether it is (lost ) 20,000 or 25,000, that is quite a lot of people. &quot;Trump said.
But he went on to say, &quot;Some states will need more time to open, and they are doing so-(and) frankly, some states (open) not fast enough.&quot;
The report said that Trump &quot;named&quot; Virginia immediately.
&quot;For example, Virginia, they want to &#39;close&#39; until mid-June.&quot; Trump said, &quot;I really believe that you can go to the park, you can go to the beach, but you (to) control the spread, keep a certain distance, I really I think that the public is already amazing, &quot;Trump said.&quot; If you say that losing 80,000 or 90,000 people is still successful, then this (coping style) is one of the reasons for our success. &quot;
