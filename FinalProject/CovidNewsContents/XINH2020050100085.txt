BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 131 domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland in April, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the National Health Commission, Friday.
Cluster infections in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province accounted for more than 60 percent of the cases, according to Mi.
April also saw 864 imported COVID-19 cases, Mi said, adding that more than 1,000 from the total imported cases had been discharged from hospitals after recovery.
Mi called for more effective and targeted measures against epidemic resurgence at home and imported infections from abroad.
