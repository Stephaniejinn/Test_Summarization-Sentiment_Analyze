Title : "He must have covid-19"; doctor in Oaxaca denounces chlorine attack
Ariticle : 
A doctor from the town of Tezoatlán de Segura y Luna in Oaxaca accused that a woman he cared for in his office, threw chlorine to "disinfect" it, in the face of the pandemic of the new coronavirus in Mexico.
The man detailed that the patient entered his office and after finishing the consultation told him "he must be covid-19 positive and continues to work; me that you, I deflate" and then threw chlorine with a syringe that I brought with it.
The doctor, 29 years old and originally from Juchitán de Zaragoza, has been serving a private practice in the municipality of Tezoatlán de Segura y Luna for three years.
The doctor attacked is 29 years old, is originally from Juchitán de Zaragoza, and has 3 years attending a private practice in the municipality of Tezoatlán de Segura y Luna.
m{795375}? I mention that after the aggression he lives in fear of the aggression that people make against doctors and nurses in this health contingency by the pandemic of covid-19, now that he was the victim of discrimination he gave notice to the municipal and health authorities of the Mixtec region.
"I repeat all aggression; Unfortunately, people are afraid of being infected, and we all fear it, but you can't assault those who help you and give you the attention," she said in her letter of complaint to the Secretary of State Health."This thing I experienced has not been pleasant, I feel sad and bad, because people see us as a freak, they believe that we are infected by caring every day for more than 20 people, but no, we also take care of ourselves and we have social responsibility."Oaxaca was the first state to reform the penal code, to punish those who assault medical personnel with jail, in the health contingency for Covid-19, but some of those affected, doctors and nurses, have not come to report for fear of major reprisals.
m{795376}Meanwhile, the chairman of the Political Coordination Board of the local Congress, Horacio Sosa, requested the intervention of the State Attorney General's Office to investigate each of the allegations of attacks on medical personnel to punish those responsible.
I ask the @FISCALIA_GobOax, in charge of @RVasconcelosM, to investigate and sanction the aggression of doctor of Tezoatlán de Segura y Luna.Since April 18th, reforms to the criminal code sanctioning these actions have been applicable in #Oaxaca.
