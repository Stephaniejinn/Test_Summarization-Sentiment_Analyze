Title : Labour leader Starmer says 27,241 people have died in UK from COVID-19
Ariticle : 
LONDON (Reuters) - Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that according to his calculations 27,241 people had died in Britain from COVID-19. 
“That makes a total to date of 27,241 recorded deaths from coronavirus and that’s probably an underestimate because of the time lag,” Starmer told parliament while asking foreign minister Dominic Raab about the number of deaths.
