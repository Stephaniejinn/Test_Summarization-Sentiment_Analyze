Title : Lloydminster hospital hit with cluster of 13 COVID-19 cases
Ariticle : 
The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) has identified a cluster of 13 cases of COVID-19 at the Lloydminster Hospital.
The cluster includes five health care workers and eight patients who contracted the virus at the hospital, located in the border city that straddles Saskatchewan and Alberta.
As of Wednesday, the remaining patients were located in separate units in the hospital.
Dr. Mandiangu Nsungu, the SHA medical health officer for the north region that includes Lloydminster, said an increase of five cases related to the hospital on Monday prompted the SHA to make the outbreak public.
“You have to find the right time to make the announcement in such a way actually so you do not panic the population overly, to not much benefit,” Nsungu told reporters during the province’s daily briefing.
Premier Scott Moe said he became aware of the outbreak on Wednesday. Nsungu said some of the diagnoses happened after patients were discharged from the hospital.

The hospital is still admitting patients with COVID-19, but other patients may be sent to another hospital. A news release from the Saskatchewan government said “key” emergency services and surgeries as well as obstetrics remain available at the hospital.
All health care workers in the hospital who have had contact with someone who has tested positive are being tested.
Of the 17 new cases announced on Wednesday, four were identified by the province as being from Lloydminster. Four COVID-19 patients were identified as being in hospital in the SHA region that includes Lloydminster.
Visitor restrictions remain in place at the Lloydminster hospital, as in all SHA facilities.
