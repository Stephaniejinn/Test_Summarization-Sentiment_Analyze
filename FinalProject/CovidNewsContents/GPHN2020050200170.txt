Region of Waterloo Public Health is reporting four more deaths related to the coronavirus.
Two of those have been linked to Trinity Village long-term care, where there's still an active outbreak, which is one of 12 in region.
Pinehaven long-term care has been added to the list, as a staff member there has come down with the virus.
There have now been 72 deaths in the region related to COVID-19.
Outbreaks have also been declared over in the medicine unit at Grand River Hospital, as well as the 3rd floor and 6th floor unit at St. Mary's General Hospital.
Meantime, 22 new cases were reported on Friday morning, raising the total to 773, with 316 now resolved.
New on Friday as well, the region is now showing a breakdown of cases of the three cities and the four townships on its dashboard.
Kitchener has the most non-facility and facility outbreak cases out of all the area municipalities.
You can find the entire breakdown on the region's website .
But the acting medical officer of health cautions the results are skewed due to the fact that only prioritized groups and settings are being tested now.
"I think that limitation to testing needs to be take into account ... I think what it does show though ... it is in all area municipalities, and I think that is the key message for people to be aware of. That people can get it anywhere in Waterloo Region, and there isn't an area municipality that isn't at risk," said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang.
With warmer weather in the forecast this weekend, regional officials are also reminding residents the emergency measures imposed by the province remain in place.
The region's CAO says if residents do go out, they should stay as close to home as possible.
"That's what we would hope to see ... people only going out when needed, and if they go out staying as close to home as possible. Avoiding congregating in large groups, avoiding crowded spaces, those type of things," said Mike Murray.
So far, six fines have been issued for those not following the rules.
Below is a breakdown of the provincial COVID-19 numbers reported on Friday:
16,608 (421 new cases)
