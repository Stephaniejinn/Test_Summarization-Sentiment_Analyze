BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are the latest developments of the COVID-19 pandemic in European countries.
ROME -- Italy on Thursday recorded the highest daily number of coronavirus recoveries since the emergency started in late February, the country's Civil Protection Department said.
The country registered on Thursday 4,693 new recoveries, the highest daily figure since the emergency began, bringing the nationwide total 75,945, according to the latest data released by the Civil Protection Department.
The death toll on Thursday was 285, bringing the total to 27,967 in the country. The new infections on the day were 1,872, bringing the total number of cases, combining infections, fatalities and recoveries, in Italy to 205,463.

MADRID -- The Spanish government will set time slots for outdoor activities, in line with social-distancing regulations, to prevent further contagion from COVID-19, Transport Minister Jose Luis Alabos said on Thursday.
Speaking on radio station Cadena Ser, Alabos said the government was working on "a set of measures that will see certain hours agreed with regional and local governments" for people to be allowed outside.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last week that adults would be allowed to take "individual exercise" outdoors from May 2. However, when children were allowed out for an hour with a parent on Sunday, there were numerous examples of people failing to follow social distancing rules.

LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday that the country is "past the peak" of the COVID-19 outbreak as another 674 patients have died, bringing the total coronavirus-related death toll in Britain to 26,711.
"We are past the peak of this disease" and are "on the downward slope", Johnson told reporters during his first Downing Street daily press briefing since his recovery from COVID-19.
Johnson said he will publish a "comprehensive" plan next week, which will cover three things: how Britain can restart the economy; how can the country get children back to school and get people into work.
