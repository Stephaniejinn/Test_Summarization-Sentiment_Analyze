Title : Shortage of Key Kits May Hurt Covid-19 Diagnosis
Ariticle : 
Lab technicians fighting the war against the coronavirus in India are armed with insufficient RNA extraction kits - one of the vital components needed for the test to confirm the infection.
Pune-based MyLab Discovery Solutions, the first Indian company to have received the validation for its Covid-19 diagnostic test kits from the Drug Controller of India, told ET that it was ramping up production of their RNA extraction kits following an overwhelming demand. The kits are for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test."Mostly the extraction kits are imported. We have just got into it and the target is to ramp up the manufacturing," managing director Hasmukh Rawal said.
The company is one of the major suppliers of kits for molecular testing. The shortage of RNA kits has added to the struggles of laboratories in the country, even as the rapid test has hit a snag in India with states facing accuracy issues.
India has so far mostly used the RT-PCR test, which uses swabs, to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus. MyLab, one of largest manufacturers of RNA extraction kits used for testing viral infections, acknowledged that its current production must be increased to meet the demand. "The target is to ramp up the production to 7 million for RNA extraction kits and 10 million RT-PCR by May, June," Rawal said.
India is facing a shortage as the kits are highly quality controlled.
