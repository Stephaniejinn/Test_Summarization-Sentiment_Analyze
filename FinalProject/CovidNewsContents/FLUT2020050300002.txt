Abstract

With the ongoing coronavirus, journals and the media have extensively covered the impacts on doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and other healthcare workers. However, one group that has rarely been mentioned despite being significantly impacted is medical students and medical education overall. This piece, prepared by both a medical student and a cardiothoracic surgeon with a long career in academic medicine, discusses the recent history of medical education and how it has led to issues now with distance-based learning due to COVID-19. It concludes with a call to action for the medical education system to adapt so it can meet the needs of healthcare learners during COVID-19 and even beyond.
