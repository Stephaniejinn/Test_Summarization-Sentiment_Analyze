VICTORIA â€” COVID-19 outbreaks at two Vancouver-area poultry processing plants are responsible for the majority of new cases reported in British Columbia on Tuesday, the provincial government says.
Health officials closed the United Poultry Co. Ltd. plant in east Vancouver and Coquitlam's Superior Poultry Processors Ltd. after dozens of workers tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Health Minister Adrian Dix says 39 of the 55 positive tests reported Tuesday are connected to the spread of the virus at the poultry processors.
There are a total of 80 COVID-19 cases linked to the two poultry facilities, with 46 at Superior Poultry and 34 at United Poultry.
B.C. has a total of 2,053 cases, of which 1,231 people have recovered.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported two more deaths in B.C. for a total of 105.
Dix said B.C.'s ongoing plans to ease restrictions revolve around efforts to prevent the virus from rebooting itself.
He said the cases in the poultry industry shows "the serious nature of particular outbreaks."
"Right now, here's something to consider, that protecting employees, protecting your employees on the business side protects your business and protects all British Columbians."
