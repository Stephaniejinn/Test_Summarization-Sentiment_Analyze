Original title: spray poison to create rumors! Pompeo was named for the fifth time by &quot;Newscast&quot;
On May 3, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo accepted an interview with ABC, claiming that &quot;there is a lot of evidence&quot; that the new coronavirus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, but could not produce substantive evidence. Change, not hesitate to &quot;dump the pot in China&quot; by means of rumours.
Today, &quot;News Network&quot; broadcast comments to fight back, the words are rare and harsh. The comment said, &quot;Evil Pompeio is rampant in front of science!&quot; This is the fifth time in a row that Pompeo has been criticized by the name &quot;Newscast&quot;.
Pompeo changed his tone many times
Self-contradictory rumors without bottom line
On the 3rd, US Secretary of State Pompeo accepted an interview with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), stating that &quot;there is a lot of evidence&quot; that the new coronavirus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, but did not mention where the evidence was. &quot;The best experts currently think that (the virus) is artificial, and I have no reason not to believe it now.&quot;
However, Pompeo&#39;s remarks were &quot;slapped&quot; by the U.S. intelligence service he once worked with. On April 30, the United States Intelligence Community, which led 16 intelligence agencies across the United States, first spoke about the origin of the virus and agreed with a broad consensus in the scientific community that the new coronavirus &quot;is neither man-made nor genetically modified.&quot;
When pointed out this contradiction, Pompeo again called &quot;Tai Chi&quot;: &quot;I have read the report of the intelligence department, and I have no reason to think they are wrong.&quot;
It is worth mentioning that Pompeo&#39;s tone of origin about the virus changed suddenly within three days. In an interview with the American media on April 30, he still said: &quot;We don&#39;t know if the (virus) comes from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, the seafood market or somewhere else, we have no answer.&quot;
Now Pompeo suddenly says there is &quot;a lot of evidence&quot;, it seems that he is echoing Trump. The US President insisted at the press conference on the 30th that &quot;there is evidence that the virus came from the Wuhan Laboratory&quot;, but he kept silent about the virus &quot;whether it was artificial&quot; and said, &quot;I cannot tell you what the evidence is.&quot;
At a press conference on May 3, Trump went further without evidence, insisting that &quot;I think they (Wuhan Research Institute) made a terrible mistake, but they didn&#39;t want to admit it.&quot;
The New York Times quoted people familiar with the situation as saying that since the outbreak, Pompeo, who had served as the director of the CIA, has taken the lead to pressure US intelligence agencies to force the virus to be related to the Wuhan laboratory. However, from the follow-up development, it clearly failed.
Four reasons for American experts to refute
WHO emphasizes that viruses come from nature
Regarding the conspiracy theory about &quot;laboratory leaking virus&quot;, Yuan Zhiming, director of Wuhan P4 Laboratory, made it clear in an interview with Reuters on April 28 that the laboratory has advanced protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of personnel and the environment And is committed to information transparency.
There are also scientific researchers in the United States. Jonna Mazet, a professor at the University of California at Davis and an expert in epidemiology and disease ecology, has worked with researchers in the Wuhan P4 laboratory including Shi Zhengli. She told &quot;Business Insider&quot; on May 2 that the two sides have worked together to develop very strict safety standards, &quot;It is extremely unlikely that a laboratory accident will leak&quot;, and gives four reasons:
First, the gene sequence of the new coronavirus does not match other coronavirus samples known in the laboratory. Shi Zhengli made this clear in his April 27 article in Scientific American. Mazete said: &quot;I recently spoke with her (Shi Zhengli) and she is absolutely certain that the (new crown) virus was never identified before the outbreak.
Second, the laboratory adopted very strict safety standards, including additional personal protective equipment and thorough disinfection of laboratory equipment. Any samples taken from bats will undergo special treatment to ensure that researchers are exposed to non-infectious and inactivated samples.
The third point is that the epidemic caused by animal-to-human transmission has a long history, and the new coronavirus is the latest and the seventh in the past century. Experts believe that the virus is more likely to be transmitted to humans through the intermediate host of animals than the leak, just like the previous Ebola and &quot;SARS&quot; epidemic. Chinese researchers discovered in February that 96% of the new coronavirus gene sequences are similar to bat virus strains.
Finally, Mazette mentioned that ordinary people are more susceptible to viruses than laboratory researchers. Shi Zhengli&#39;s team wears protection when searching for bat samples in caves and in the wild. Tourists, hunters, poachers, or people who trade in food are less protected in the same environment and are more likely to be infected. Peter Daszak, the head of the non-governmental organization Eco-Health Alliance, revealed that his colleagues&#39; survey in Southeast Asia found that between 1 million and 7 million people are exposed to the risk of animal-to-human diseases every year.
Mazete believes that the most important thing before the epidemic is cooperation, and the US government&#39;s &quot;dump pot&quot; and the &quot;circulated laboratory leak theory&quot; that have been circulated may hinder future scientific cooperation and information sharing between China and the US This is very important for the traceability, prediction and prevention of the next outbreak of the new coronavirus.
In response to a few politicians advocating the new coronavirus &quot;virus laboratory in Wuhan&quot;, the head of the World Health Organization&#39;s health emergency project, Michael Ryan, said at a press conference on May 1 &quot;Where did the new coronavirus found in Wuhan come from We constantly listen to the opinions of countless scientists who have studied gene sequences and viruses, and we are pretty sure that this virus originated from nature. &quot;
&quot;News Network&quot; Yanci hit back
Pompeo was named for the fifth time
On May 4, Pompeio&#39;s fallacy, &quot;Newscast&quot; broadcast comments to fight back, the words are rare and harsh. The comment said, &quot;Evil Pompeio blasts poison in front of science!&quot;
In the face of the unanimous conclusion that the emerging new coronavirus in the global scientific community stems from nature, American politicians may not find the &quot;new material&quot; that smears China, and they lie rashly and repeatedly spread &quot;laboratory virus leaks&quot; and &quot;man-made viruses&quot;. Wait for rumors. U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo recaptured his self-made lies in an interview with the media on the 3rd, saying that &quot;there is a lot of evidence that the (virus) is from the Wuhan laboratory.&quot;
Ironically, just when US politicians claimed to &quot;see evidence&quot;, the US National Intelligence Director&#39;s Office issued a statement saying that &quot;the new virus is not artificial or genetically modified.&quot;
In fact, the so-called &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that the virus originated in the laboratory was rejected by people in the international scientific community and the public health community at the outset. &quot;The epidemic is a natural disaster&quot; is already a consensus of the international community. More and more scientific studies strongly refute the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; of the origin of the virus.
There is a sinister plot behind the American political politician&#39;s political slapstick.
Unjust is doomed to destruction. Whether it&#39;s a decision-making mistake that led to a major defeat in this national defense epidemic, or to create a &quot;political virus&quot; to undermine global cooperation, the actions of American politicians are writing an ugly history. If you let evil politicians like Pompeo continue to swindle and cheat, America&#39;s &quot;greatness again&quot; may only be a joke!
It is worth noting that this is the fifth time that Pompeo has been criticized by the name &quot;Newscast&quot;. From April 27 to April 30, &quot;Newscast&quot; broadcasted six blockbuster comments in a row, of which five of the protagonists were Pompeo. Of the 5 articles, 4 articles directly clicked on the name &quot;Pompeo&quot;-
On April 27, &quot;
On April 28, &quot;
On April 29, &quot;
On April 30, &quot;
Viruses are the common enemy of all mankind. The United States has not pinpointed its true enemies, but has blindly attacked and discredited other countries. Pompeo&#39;s &quot;spraying&quot; diplomacy is tantamount to solving problems and will only cost more people. Using countless fresh lives as a bet to win votes for re-election, this approach is not only short-sighted, it is also called evil!
