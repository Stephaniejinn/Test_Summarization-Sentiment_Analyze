Title : New York tries to track down new virus infections source
Ariticle : 
In an effort to limit further coronavirus infections, New York is initiating an intensive effort to identify the population with antibodies and determine the source of new cases.
Newly admitted virus patients into hospitals — a majority in the downstate region, Rockland and south — hover at about 900 daily on a three-day average, including 831 Friday.
While markedly lower than the state pandemic apex, Gov. Andrew Cuomo characterized the number as "still an unacceptably high rate."
"We must lower the infection rate," Cuomo said at this Saturday morning press briefing, conducted at a New York Transit Authority rail yard in Queens.
To that end, the state Department of Health is collecting more detailed demographic data on incoming cases, identifying residence, age, gender, race, underlying conditions, occupation, commuting method and other data to determine patterns in the newly infected and other clues on how new cases are generated.
"Are these infections being spread through the home?" Cuomo said, or are the new cases mostly limited to front line workers. More layered data will enable the state to ascertain the infection source, he said.
In preliminary antibody testing of 15,000 people, up from 3,000 tested last week, one in five New York City residents tested positive for the virus antibody, ranging from a high of 27.6% in the Bronx to 18.4% in Queens.
Across the state, 12.3% were positive for the COVID-19 anitibody, from 6% in Western New York to 1.2% in the North Country.
For the second day in a row, virus-related deaths recorded in the state were below 300 Friday, though the total of 299 represented a slight rise from the 289 reported Thursday.
At the peak of the pandemic, New York was reporting more than 700 virus-related death daily.
Nearly 19,000 virus-related deaths have been recorded statewide, representing 29% of the nearly 66,000 fatalities recorded nationwide through Friday.
Cuomo noted vulnerable communities, the elderly in nursing home settings and minorities, are "paying a higher price" than other populations.
The state will be distributing 7 million cloth masks to the state's 600 nursing homes and public housing projects in a continuing effort to cap the virus spread.
Further, with 1.6 million New Yorkers filing first-time jobless claims — 968,000 in the five boroughs and Long Island alone — over seven weeks ended April 25, based of state Department of Labor statistics, New York is fortifying the food banks statewide with $25 million in funding.
New York City: $11 million
Long Island: $1.6 million
Westchester: $1 million
Capital: $4.4 million
Finger Lakes: $1,7 million
Southern Tier: $1.1 million
Western NY: $2.1 million
Central NY: $2.2 million
Cuomo urged other philanthropic organizations to also contribute to the cause to assist in the cause to feed the families of the newly unemployed.
