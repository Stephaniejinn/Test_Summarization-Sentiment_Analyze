Title : UN Palestinian refugee agency operating on 'month-to-month' basis
Ariticle : 
In 2018, the US halted annual payments of $360m to UNRWA, which provides assistance to some 5.5 million refugees. 
Scrambling to tackle COVID-19 in camps across the Middle East, the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said it only has enough cash to operate until the end of May because of American funding cuts.
In 2018 President Donald Trump's administration halted annual payments of $360m to the United Nations Relief and Works AgencyÂ 
for Palestine Refugees 
(UNRWA), which provides assistance to some 5.5 million registered refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
Elizabeth Campbell, UNRWA's director in Washington, told reporters the loss of US aid had a "corrosive impact" on the agency's ability to help vulnerable people.
"We are basically operating on a month-to-month basis. Right now, we have funding to pay our 30,000 healthcare workers until the end of this month," Campbell said in a Zoom conference call from Washington.
She said UNRWA had only secured one-third of its $1.2bn annual budget and it was suffering its "worst financial crisis" since beginning operations 70 years ago.
The agency is trying to plug the $800m shortfall in part by appealing to European and Gulf countries for emergency donations, Campbell said.
Donations from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and Japan have helped fill UNRWA's 2020 budget gap, she said, while Saudi Arabia also provided project-specific funding.
The United States was by far UNRWA's biggest donor until it withdrew funding, calling for reforms and suggesting its services be transferred to refugee host countries.
Palestinian refugees are mostly descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or who fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation. Nearly one-third live in 58 camps where UNRWA provides services.
Many refugees fear the dwindling aid they receive could fall further as the coronavirus crisis persists and donors shift priorities.
UNRWA has tried to halt the spread of COVID-19 in and around camps, closing all of its 276 schools that are attended by close to 300,000 children.
It has launched a $14m emergency appeal for coronavirus funding, and says it will issue another larger aid request in the coming days.
