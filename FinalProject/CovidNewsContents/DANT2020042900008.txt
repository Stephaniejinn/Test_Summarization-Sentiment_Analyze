Title : Urgent warning of serious condition related to corona virus in children
Ariticle : 



British doctors believe that a serious condition related to corona virus may appear in children



An &quot;emergency alert&quot; has been sent to general practitioners in London over the past three weeks warning of &quot;a marked increase in the number of children of all ages attending to patients with multisystem inflammation that needs attention.&quot; intensive care, &quot;according to a report in the Health Service Journal.

The warning states that &quot;there is a growing concern about Covid-19-related inflammatory syndrome presenting in children in the UK, or there may be another unspecified infectious pathogen associated with these cases. &quot;

Another warning, issued by the Pediatric Intensive Care Society, urges doctors to &quot;treat patients with these symptoms to be urgent problems,&quot; according to HSJ.

The corona virus pandemic has so far affected more elderly patients and the total number of cases of this unidentified condition in children remains small.

However, the Pediatric Active Care Association has called for &quot;early discussion&quot; of all new cases of the condition to identify its etiology and limit its spread.

Symptoms of this condition are &quot;toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children&quot;, as well as &quot;Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms&quot; and &quot;heart inflammation&quot;.

The warning states that &quot;this has been observed in children with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as negative PCR children. Also, serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been seen.&quot; before.&quot;

The report comes as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to reopen schools after a nationwide blockade since March.

Asked about reports of the new condition, the British prime minister said during a press conference on Monday &quot;we are certainly aware of the report and the Ministry of Health is reviewing it.&quot;
