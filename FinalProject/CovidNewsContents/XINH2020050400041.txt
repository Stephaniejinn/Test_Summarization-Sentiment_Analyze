Title : Chinese "Fire Eye" helps Serbia detect coronavirus
Ariticle : 


The Chinese-donated "Fire eye" lab in Serbia has significantly increased the country's capability of detecting coronavirus by conducting around 2,000 coronavirus tests per day.The nucleic acid testing lab is a robot that extracts nucleic acid automatically, 10 times faster than a lab operator and with a smaller margin of error.The second lab, soon to be installed in the southern city of Nis, will perform around 1,000 coronavirus tests a day. With these two labs, Serbia's daily testing capacity will be doubled.
