Title : Pope asked for "universal access" to coronavirus treatments
Ariticle : 
Pope Francis today called for "universal access" to coronavirus treatments, while calling for a "transparent and selfless" collaboration worldwide to find a vaccine.
"Once again I want to express my closeness to the sick in Covid-19, to those who are engaged in their care and to all those who somehow suffer from the pandemic," the pontiff said, reciting Regina Caeli's prayer from the Vatican.
"At the same time, I wish to support and encourage the international collaboration that is being activated with various initiatives to respond appropriately and effectively to the serious crisis we are experiencing," Jorge Bergoglio added from the Vatican Apostolic Palace, in a streaming message.
"It is important, in fact, to pool scientific capacities, transparently and selflessly, to find vaccines and treatments, and to ensure universal access to essential technologies that enable every person infected, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary health cures," he said.
Before the prayer he replaces after Easter with the traditional Angelus, Bergoglio recalled that there are "so many shepherds who in the world give their lives for the faithful, even in this pandemic".
"Many, more than 100 here in Italy have passed away. I also think of other pastors who care for the good of the people, the doctors," he said this Sunday, celebrating Mass in his chapel of Casa Santa Marta, at 7 o's Rome (2 in Argentina).
"There is talk of doctors, what they do, but it must be borne in mind that, in Italy alone, 154 doctors have died, in an act of service. May the example of these pastors, priests and medical shepherds help us to care for the holy faithful people of God," he concluded.
