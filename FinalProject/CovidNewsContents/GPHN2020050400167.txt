US President Donald Trump said a COVID-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year.
The representative also noted that the U.S. government is "backing up with all its power" to remdesivir, a drug that has shown promising results against the disease that causes coronavirus.
Trump made his statements during a televised forum on fox news channel.
The representative sat inside the Lincoln Memorial and answered questions from two Fox presenters and people who asked their questions through the channel's social media platforms.
Trump responded to a man from Nebraska who recovered from COVID-19, telling him, "We think we'll have a vaccine by the end of this year."
He also commented that his government is vigorously pushing the remdesivir.
U.S. public health authorities have said that developing a vaccine is likely to take between a year and 18 months. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in late April that it is conceivable, if a vaccine develops soon, that could be widely distributed even in January.

The White House's battle-to-coronavirus coordinator called it "extremely troubling" that people did not wear masks or stay estranged when protesting against confinement measures in Michigan and other states.
Dr. Deborah Birx responded to the hundreds of protesters who last week gathered in front of the Michigan legislature demanding that business be reopened.
In the "Fox News Sunday" program, the expert said people "will feel guilty for the rest of their lives" if they get the disease or pass it on to family members.
"We have to protect ourselves at the same time that we can express our discontent," Birx said.

Some 1,000 health professionals have been hired to deal with the coronavirus crisis in Italy's overcrowded prisons.
Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia told journalists on Sunday that if more doctors are needed, they will be hired.
Prison work will begin on Monday and last until 31 July. Some 20,000 people ran for office. The initiative was presented at a press conference outside the Rebibbia Prison in Rome, where 62 of the medical professions will be temporarily transferred.
At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in Italy, prisoners in several prisons mutinied by reporting that they lacked the hygienic conditions needed at the moment.

The drug regulator in Sweden said Sunday that the European Union is investigating whether the drug remdesivir could be used to treat coronavirus within the 27-nation block after a similar decision in the United States.
The drug was originally developed to treat Ebola and is produced by California-based Gilead Sciences Inc.. Clinical trials have shown that the drug helps shorten the recovery time of people who are severely ill with COVID-19.
