Title : Nigeria: COVID-19 - NGO Asks U.S.A., IMF, Others to Halt Loans to Nigeria
Ariticle : 
The International Institute for Humanitarian and Environmental Law has asked the United States, European Union and others to halt all financial support to Nigeria over alleged unfair palliative distribution and human rights violations.
In the letter signed by the Registrar of the NGO, Cyprain Edward-Ekpo Eno Esq, dated April 13, 2020, they also requested President Donald Trump and the EU not to provide further loans and grants to Nigeria, "Until a prospective data and flawless methodology for palliatives distribution is presented, and official commitment to implement same, as well as official commitment for protection of human rights during the period."
"A savvy of deductive reasoning to such fact will be to ask officials to present a verifiable data of the 2.6 million poor households they claim to have given N20,000 each as palliatives. Such data should include names of persons, their streets, cities, local government areas and states of residence, telephone numbers, as well as their means of identification," the statement read.
The NGO also backed the US investigation into the role of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in China since the outbreak of the COVID-19.
The US government in April warned Nigeria that the $320m General Sani Abacha loot planned for return must be placed in an account and must not be stolen. This is even as US senators also called on Trump not to return the funds to Nigeria over alleged corruption and human rights concerns.
