Title : Number of identified Covid-19 cases in Russia growing due to broadening testing scope - epidemiology expert
Ariticle : 
MOSCOW. May 3 (Interfax) - The growing numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia over the past few days does not mean necessarily that the epidemic is broadening, Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Nikolai Gamaleya National Epidemiology and Microbiology Research Center, said on Sunday.
"The figure is growing because the testing scope is broadening," Gintsburg told Interfax.
The number of coronavirus tests conducted in Russia has doubled over the past ten days, Gintsburg said. "You don't have to be a mathematician to understand that we would reveal more infected people," he said.
The growing number of identified Covid-19 cases should not fear anyone, he said.
Gintsburg also praised the fact that a lot of Muscovites have left the city for their suburb summer homes.
The coronavirus operative response headquarters said earlier on Sunday that 5,948 coronavirus cases had been identified in Moscow over the previous 24 hours, which is a record large daily number of Covid-19 cases recorded in the city. The total number of Covid-19 cases recorded in Moscow has reached 68,606.
Russia has recorded over 10,000 new cases of coronavirus infection and 58 people with Covid-19 have died over the past 24 hours. "Another 10,633 coronavirus infection Covid-19 cases have been recorded in 85 regions of Russia over the past 24 hours. This figure includes 5,345 cases (50.3%) without clinical symptoms, which were uncovered proactively," the coronavirus operative response headquarters said in a bulletin on Sunday.
This brings the total number of coronavirus infection cases recorded during the epidemic in all 85 regions of Russia to 134,687 (+8.6%), it said.
