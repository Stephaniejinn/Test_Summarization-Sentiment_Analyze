NEW COVID-19 SYMPTOMS AND TESTING EXPANSIONS
Aside from fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and runny nose, Hinshaw said people experiencing the following symptoms qualify for COVID-19 tests: headache, muscle or joint aches, feeling unwell, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, and pink eye.
"Our aggressive testing approach is helping us identify cases quickly," Hinshaw said, and mentioned AHS performed 3,775 tests since Sunday's update.
"Adding these new symptoms will allow us to be more confident that we can identify as early as possible the small percentage of cases that may present with more unusual symptoms."
Also, in an attempt to find asymptomatic cases, AHS will now test close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Hinshaw said this is a "necessary step."
"Asymptomatic testing of close contacts is one more tool we can use to prevent further transmission in our communities by identifying positive cases as soon as possible."
The new testing expansion also includes people newly admitted to continuing care homes across Alberta, and those returning to these facilities from hospital.
