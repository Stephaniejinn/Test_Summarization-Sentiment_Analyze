COVID-19: More front-line workers now eligible for emergency child care; New cases in Ontario way down; Five new Ottawa deaths Back to video
More front-line workers in Ontario will be able to apply for free emergency child care, Premier Doug Ford announced Wednesday.
The list of eligible individuals has been expanded to include workers in meat-packing companies, retail, pharmacy and grocery store workers, truckers, long-term care and retirement home workers, interpreters and intervenors who support people who are deaf, and certain federal employees, including those in the military, added Education Minister Stephen Lecce.

Thirty-seven additional child-care centres have been approved to reopen in the coming days to accommodate additional children, with a list of centres available on the Ontario government’s COVID-19 webpage .
Meanwhile, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario dropped substantially on Wednesday, with only 347 additional cases reported – the first time in several weeks the daily case total was in the 300s.
The number of new cases in Ontario had been slowly declining for several days, with most in the 400s-range, until Tuesday’s provincial data showed a spike of 525 new cases in the previous 24 hours. Now, that daily total has fallen again, substantially.

This is the lowest number of new cases the province has seen in three weeks, according to the premier.
“This is a positive trend to give people hope, that we’re getting close to opening up. I can’t give you dates right now, but what I can give you is hope,” said Ford, addressing the media without a script after technical difficulties left him ad-libbing. “The screen went on me, so I’m going to talk from the heart here.”
To proceed with any lifting of restrictions in Ontario, Health Minister Christine Elliott has stressed that the number of new cases needs to drop consistently.
“There may be blips in the system from time to time, but we definitely need … to see a downward trend,” Elliott said Tuesday.

While other provinces are setting dates for economic reopening – some in early May – Ontario has yet to do the same. Asked about this Wednesday, Ford said: “I’m not willing to roll the dice – and we aren’t Quebec, and we aren’t Manitoba and Saskatchewan,” though he was quick to note he thinks those premiers are doing “an incredible job.
“I just ask people to hang in there,” said Ford. “I’m feeling very positive about the results that we’ve seen over the last four or five days. If it continues, then we’re going to be able to open up a lot sooner than we’re hoping.”
Asked about the divergent approaches to reopening the economy in Ontario and Quebec, Ford was supportive of his counterpart’s approach. “I respect Premier Legault … I don’t want to comment on him versus us, we’re two different scenarios. And he’s going to see if it works in his province, and I wish him all the best.”

However, Ford reiterated his desire for those in other provinces to avoid crossing into Ontario. “We don’t want people, right now, coming across the border … if you don’t live in Ontario, stay at home.”
The Ontario government had set a goal of 14,000 daily tests by April 29, but has yet to make it to that level. On Wednesday, the province reported 11,554 tests completed the previous day, up from 10,852 reported Tuesday, but down from testing in the 12,000s in the days before.
Asked about the dip in testing at his Wednesday press conference, Ford said he’d look into getting an explanation. Meanwhile, “we’re going to make sure that we continue increasing the testing … they’ve been doing pretty good actually,” said Ford, who pushed hard and publicly for testing to ramp up in recent weeks.

Ford also noted that testing will be expanded at the emergency child-care centres.
Across the province, 45 additional deaths were confirmed. In a separate tally that counts long-term care deaths in Ontario, 45 deaths were also recorded in the last day. Provincewide, there have been 996 deaths and 15,728 cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Nearly 3,500 cases and 522 deaths have stemmed from outbreaks of the virus in Ontario long-term care homes. In total, 181 LTC facilities have reported outbreaks (though some of these have since been resolved).
Of the 977 COVID-19 patients hospitalized, 235 were in intensive care and 186 were on ventilators. More than 60 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario are now resolved.

Local
There have been 76 deaths and 1,297 confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Ottawa since the beginning of the pandemic, including 76 new cases announced Wednesday and five new deaths.
Of the 38 Ottawa COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized, eight are in intensive care.
There are 23 ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 in local institutions, mostly long-term care, retirement homes and hospitals. Sixty-four deaths and 575 cases of COVID-19 have stemmed from institutional outbreaks in Ottawa.
Some 42 per cent of Ottawa’s COVID-19 cases are now resolved, meaning symptoms have cleared up and isolation is no longer required.

Asked on Wednesday if there were further plans in the works to encourage people to continue physical distancing as the weather improves, Mayor Jim Watson talked about initiatives already taken to close streets to motor vehicle traffic, such as Queen Elizabeth Driveway and Byron Avenue.
“We set up a process where if members of council have an area they want to cordon off, they can approach staff and it goes through the Emergency Operations Committee, and if that is approved then the councillors can use their traffic-calming budget to actually cordon off an area.
“So there are opportunities on a ward-by-ward basis, but we still have to remind people that while the parks are technically closed — we are allowing people to walk through them, jog through them, cycle through them, but we ask them not to stay and gather.”

Watson added that he hoped to see greater access to parks. “I know with warm weather, that’s something that obviously kids want to participate in, but we have to put public safety in front of the ability to open the parks too soon and spread the virus even further.
“The decision of the park-closing is a provincial one,” he noted, “and they will have to lift that, and I suspect that if they do lift it, there will still be some limitations in terms of not using the playground equipment, for instance.
“These are decisions that are going to be based on the advice of our medical officers of health and the chief medical officer of health, and obviously the sooner we can open the parks, the better, with the good weather, but I’m not prepared to risk greater public safety by opening them too soon and then creating the opposite of physical distancing.”

In Ottawa, a staff member at the city’s largest long-term care home, the 211-bed Peter D. Clark Centre, has tested positive for COVID-19.
At CHEO, a new clinic launched Tuesday to make sure babies and toddlers don’t miss their first immunizations due to COVID-19-related closures and risk outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the pandemic’s wake.
Meanwhile, at The Ottawa Hospital, a prominent immunotherapy researcher has turned his attention to developing a vaccine for COVID-19 with the help of a $250,000 “fast grant” from The Thistledown Foundation, a charity established by the founder of Shopify and his wife.

Quebec
Quebec has 26,594 cases of COVID-19, an increase of 837 from yesterday, Deputy Premier Geneviève Guilbault said in her briefing this afternoon.
The death toll is now 1,761, an increase of 79 people.
She announced that Quebec is ready to lift some travel restrictions in the regions, including police checkpoints.
But Guilbault asked Quebecers not to travel between regions for “unnecessary” reasons such as shopping. And indoor and outdoor gatherings are still banned.

Here’s the timeline for the reopening:
May 4: the Laurentians, the Lanaudière and Chaudière-Appalaches.
May 11: Outaouais (except Gatineau), Abitibi and Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.
May 18: Bas St-Laurent, Gaspésie, the Magdalen Islands and the Charlevoix.
One additional death and three new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the Outaouais on Wednesday, for a total of three deaths and 273 confirmed cases in the region, which includes Gatineau.

Starting this weekend in Nova Scotia, the CAF Snowbirds “will head across Canada to salute Canadians doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the federal, provincial and territorial governments released a shared set of principles to guide the reopening of the Canadian economy, such as “sufficient public health capacity” to test and trace COVID-19 cases and having workplace protocols in place.
“Every region, every province, every territory is facing a very different situation right now,” Trudeau said Wednesday, when questioned on the lack of specific, measurable targets in the guidelines. “That’s why we needed to make sure that the foundational elements were there that we could all follow as Canadians, but recognize that different jurisdictions will act differently.

“But there is a common desire right across the country from all premiers to ensure that we’re doing this right.”
Trudeau also announced the federal government plans to provide between $1,000 and $5,000 for students who volunteer to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trudeau did not say when the new Canada Student Services Grant will be rolled out, but says specific supports will also be set up for Indigenous students.
The prime minister said the federal government is also planning to extend research grants, fellowships and other support to graduate students and researchers.
The new measures are on top of $9 billion in support for students unveiled last week.
