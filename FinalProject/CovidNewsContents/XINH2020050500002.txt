BRUSSELS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Belgium began its first phase of deconfinement on Monday as the Belgian health institute Sciensano confirmed that the spread of the virus in the country is decreasing with a COVID-19 reproduction rate of 0.6 over the past 24 hours.
With the reproduction rate of 0.6, an infected person infects less than one person now, unlike the rate of 2 to 3 at the beginning of the epidemic.

The main change is in the economic sector, with the authorization to resume all so-called "B2B" activities, namely those between companies. About 150,000 people are expected to return to work across all sectors except for restaurants, shops, events and tourism, according to figures from the Flemish employers' organisation Voka on Sunday.
Teleworking remains the norm. Fabric shops are allowed to open to provide fabric for masks. Gatherings and meetings between friends at home remain prohibited.
