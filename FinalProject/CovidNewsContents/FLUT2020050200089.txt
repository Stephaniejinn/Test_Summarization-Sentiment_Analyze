Abstract

Since its inception in Wuhan in December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shattered the economies and health-care infrastructures worldwide. Even the best of health-care systems (United States, Italy) have been overwhelmed and collapsed because of this unprecedented pandemic. India is preparing itself for the onslaught of Coronavirus. After recording its first case on January 30th, 2020, the rise was slow until the last week of March. However, since then, the number of cases has increased exponentially, and as on April 14th, 2020, there have been more than 10,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India, which has resulted in more than 350 deaths.
