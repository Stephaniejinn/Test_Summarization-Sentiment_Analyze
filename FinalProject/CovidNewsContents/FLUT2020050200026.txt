Abstract

The present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting pregnant patients worldwide. Although it appears that the severity of disease is reduced in pregnant patients, some are likely to develop severe disease. Our objective is to summarize the basic initial respiratory support interventions recommended for pregnant patients with infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
