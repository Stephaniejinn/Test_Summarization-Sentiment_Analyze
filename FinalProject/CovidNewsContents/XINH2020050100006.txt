Epidemic control measures for transportation carriers, hotels and tourist spots should be further specified and strictly taken to guard against the risks from the gathering of tourists, according to the meeting.
If another epidemic outbreak occurs, swift handling and targeted control should be in place to block its transmission routes as soon as possible, and information concerning the outbreak should be true, transparent and in time, the group said.
Warning against complacency in COVID-19 prevention and control, the group called for efforts to improve normalized epidemic control, especially in key areas and among key groups, to resolutely prevent the epidemic from rebounding.
The group also put forward specific requirements for epidemic control in communities, schools, supermarkets and other public venues, while stressing more efforts to enhance the capability of COVID-19 testing.
Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy head of the leading group, attended the meeting.
