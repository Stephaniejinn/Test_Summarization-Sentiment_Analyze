Original title: Governor of Illinois, USA: The White House â€™s help against the epidemic is minimal
On May 3, local time, Illinois Governor Pritzker said in an interview with local media that the White House has provided little help to the state government in the past few weeks in fighting the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
Pritzker also added, &quot;We have received some useful guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control, but most of the experience provided by the White House for several weeks is useless.&quot; He also accused Trump of citing the National Defense Production Law to produce new coronavirus detection reagents earlier to provide the state government with the necessary supplies for virus testing to avoid the chaos that states compete for.
Recently, the White House promised that 600,000 test kits will be distributed to Illinois in May. Pritzker expressed gratitude for this, but he also said that this is still not enough, and hopes that the White House will continue to help states get more test reagents. Strive to further strengthen the detection in the summer. (CCTV reporter Xu Tao)
