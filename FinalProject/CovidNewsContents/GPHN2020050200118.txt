Title : Health authorities probe Newmarch lapse
Ariticle : 
NSW health authorities are investigating possible breaches of infection control at a Sydney aged care facility at the centre of a coronavirus cluster.
Of the five new COVID-19 cases in the state over the last 24 hours, two were recorded at Anglicare Newmarch House.
There have been 61 cases and 13 deaths related to transmission at the western Sydney facility.
On Saturday, it was announced that two staff members had contracted the virus, and NSW health has deployed two infection control nurses to the facility to review its procedures.
"We've clearly seen transmission that on the surface looks like there's been breaches in infection control amongst particularly the staff," NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant said.
"And that's obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred."
NSW's coronavirus tally has now grown to 3031 with no new deaths recorded.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the new five cases came from 8809 tests - the second highest rate of testing recorded across NSW since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis.
Mr Hazzard also said he had eased restrictions on people attending beauty salons to purchase retail products.
