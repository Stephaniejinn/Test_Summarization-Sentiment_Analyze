Title : NDP leader calls for checkpoints from Alberta to Sask.
Ariticle : 
Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili is calling for checkpoints at the border with Alberta, which is battling much higher rates of COVID-19 with cumulative cases now at 5,165.
There have been 389 cases in Saskatchewan, by contrast. The province’s most troubling active outbreak, in the northwestern community of La Loche, has been largely traced t
o an oil worker (or workers) returning from across the border near Fort McMurray.
Meili said informational 
checkpoints are now needed to encourage travellers from our western neighbour to turn around if they don’t need to cross for essential reasons. That goes for entry points into both northern and southern Saskatchewan.
“Yes, checkpoints there to ask people why they’re travelling,” Meili explained. “If they are travelling for reasons that are avoidable, encourage them to make other plans, and keep track of what traffic is. I think a lot of what we need right now is information.”

Saskatchewan’s chief medical health officer has issued a recommendation against interprovincial travel. But Meili called for something with more “guts,” using a word suggested by a reporter.
“I would say, at the very least, strong recommendation and checkpoints to see who’s actually following those recommendations, and encourage those people who aren’t travelling for absolutely necessary means to turn around,” he said.
Meili said the measures he supports wouldn’t actually ban travel into Saskatchewan on a mandatory basis. But that option might need to be explored if too many are found to ignore the recommendations.

“If you’re discovering that you’ve got lots of unnecessary travel happening, despite it being a strong recommendation, and those checkpoints in place, then we might need to go to stronger measures and actual prohibitions,” he said.
“I think only if you discover that there were ongoing failures to follow those recommendations would you need to introduce stronger enforcement.”
On Wednesday, Premier Scott Moe was asked about his thoughts on interprovincial travel, including the possibility of mandatory self-isolation for those coming from Alberta. He said the issue is being explored.
“We have actually discussed and continue to discuss those options in the days ahead,” said Moe.

The government did not provide an immediate response to Meili’s suggestion, except to say that Moe will be available at 2:30 p.m. during a wide-ranging press conference to react.
Currently, there are travel restrictions into the Northern Saskatchewan Administrative District, which covers a wide expanse of the province from roughly Tobin Lake all the way to the border with the Northwest Territories. Only critical travel is allowed.
But Meili said there isn’t enough support in place to assist communities that are setting up checkpoints to control movement north. He called for $10 million to support northern communities, though that is also meant to cover issues like food security and other challenges.

Moe has said discussions are ongoing about how to adjust the restrictions, which could be tightened around La Loche and loosened in other areas that are less affected.
Buckley Belanger, the NDP MLA for the provincial riding that includes La Loche, said resources are desperately needed.
“The communities themselves, whether they’re first nations or Metis, they are the ones that are paying some of these people to man the checks stops. The province hasn’t been paying any of that,” he said.
“It’s very expensive proposition.”
