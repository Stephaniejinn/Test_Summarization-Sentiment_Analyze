Title : Keep good hand hygiene habits to prevent infection of communicable diseases
Ariticle : 
				     The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (May 4), in support of the Hand Hygiene Day tomorrow (May 5), appealed to the public to keep good hand hygiene habits. Performing hand hygiene frequently - especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes - is key to preventing COVID-19 and other communicable diseases.
 
     The slogan of this year's Hand Hygiene Day is "Let's Remind Each Other Keep Hands Clean Together", which aims to enhance hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers. Patients and healthcare workers can be good working partners in improving hand hygiene practices for their mutual benefit. Members of the public and healthcare workers can remind each other to clean their hands as and when necessary.
 
     A new video (

) encourages the public to observe good personal hand hygiene and reminds others to do the same, whether they are at home, at school, in a clinic or a hospital ward. Good hand hygiene is the primary measure proven to be effective in preventing healthcare associated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance.
           
     The public may visit the CHP’s Hand Hygiene Day 2020 webpage (
