Ariticle : 
LANSING — The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported 1,052 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 160 new deaths on Tuesday, April 28.
Forty of the 160 deaths reported on Tuesday were part of a review of prior death certificates.
Still, the figures reported on Tuesday represent a jump after three consecutive days of reporting lower-than-average new cases and deaths.
In total, Michigan now has 39,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,567 confirmed deaths.
The Ottawa County Department of Public Health reported 19 new cases on Tuesday, raising the county's total to 210 cases, along with nine deaths.
The Allegan County Health Department reported 84 total cases, along with one death.
Health officials from both counties believe there is evidence of community transmission of COVID-19, and residents should assume that they could come into contact with the disease any time they are in public.
