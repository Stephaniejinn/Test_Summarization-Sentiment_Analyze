Ariticle : 

TTO - In the context of many US states moving to reopen, the government and a prestigious research organization have published their estimates of the total number of Americans likely to die from COVID-19.




WHO: US has not submitted evidence, claiming origin of COVID-19 is &#39;speculative&#39;



Mr. Trump predicted the terrible thing: 100,000 people died of COVID-19 in the United States



The US has warned China to &quot;take consequences&quot; if it does not comply with the trade agreement

According to the newspaper
New York Times
, an internal report by the Trump administration that the newspaper receives is estimated to have a steady increase in the number of cases as well as daily deaths over the coming weeks.
Specifically, the report suggests that by June there will be an additional 200,000 new cases each day (currently about 25,000 cases per day) and the number of deaths per day is expected to reach around 3,000 by June 1 ( an increase of 70% compared with the figure of about 1,750 people died in the current 24h).
These estimates are based on data from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
In addition to the government&#39;s own estimates, another prestigious research institution, the University of Washington&#39;s Medical Research and Evaluation Institute (IHME), has also revised its estimates, doubling the number. Americans can die of this disease. The White House frequently cites IHME estimates of the disease.
IHME now estimates that by early August nearly 135,000 Americans will die from COVID-19. This is an estimate that is double the estimate made by IHME on April 17. At that time, the organization identified that from 4-8 to 60.308 people will die from COVID-19. But as of today 5-5 hours Vietnam, the US has more than 68,000 died of corona.
IHME explained that revising their estimates reflects &quot;an increase in activity levels in most states as well as the planned relaxation of social spatial measures in 31 states through May 11, It also shows that increased contact activity among people will increase corona virus infection. &quot;
On May 3-5, US President Donald Trump stated that the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US could reach 100,000, more than double his own prediction made two weeks earlier.



COVID-19 epidemic 4-5: The US has more than 67,000 deaths, Vietnam more cases cured

TTO - In the context that the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the US exceeded the 67,000 mark on 3-5 days, President Trump still expressed confidence about reopening the states&#39; economy. In Vietnam, just 2 more cases have recovered, was discharged from the hospital.
