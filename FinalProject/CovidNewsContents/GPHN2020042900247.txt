Title : Update: Gilead Says Shorter Remdesivir Regimen Is Effective And Drug Met Primary Endpoint In Government Study -- MarketWatch
Ariticle : 
Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) on Wednesday morning announced data from two clinical trials testing its experimental drug remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients. The drugmaker's stock was halted in premarket trading on Wednesday in advance of company disclosures about remdesivir's performance in the studies. Gilead said an open-label Phase 3 trial testing the therapy in severely ill patients found that those taking a 5-day or 10-day course of treatment led to similar results. At least 52% of participants taking either dosing regimen were discharged from the hospital after 14 days of treatment, and at least 53% of those patients were reported as reaching "clinical recovery." "Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19," Gilead chief medical officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement.
 "The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir." Minutes before this topline data was released, Gilead also said that a government-run clinical trial evaluating remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients met the study's primary endpoint. That study is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is expected to provide additional information about that trial, Gilead said. Gilead's stock has gained 21.0% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is down 11.3%.
