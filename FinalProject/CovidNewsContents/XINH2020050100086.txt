WUHAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province will lower its novel coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level starting May 2, a local official announced Friday.
Prevention and control measures against the epidemic will also be adjusted following the downgrading of the emergency response level, Yang Yunyan, deputy governor of Hubei, said at a press conference.
After more than three months of precise and tight prevention and control, the virus spread is "basically cut off" in Hubei, Yang said.

"The unprecedented emergency measures during the initial phase have basically cut off the spread of the novel coronavirus," Yang said. "In line with national regulations and the provincial contingency plan, Hubei has basically met the condition to lower the emergency response level."
No new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Hubei Thursday, the provincial health commission said Friday.
This marks that Hubei, the once hardest hit Chinese province, has had no new confirmed COVID-19 cases for 27 consecutive days since April 4.
Hubei was cleared of confirmed COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
