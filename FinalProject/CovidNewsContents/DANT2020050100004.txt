Title : Miracle of 102-year-old woman won cancer and overcome 2 epidemics
Ariticle : 

Angelina Friedman was born in 1918 on a boat returning Italian immigrants to the United States. Her mother died when she was born, and Friedman was raised by two sisters until her father came to the United States and all their families moved to Brooklyn, said Joanne Merola, her daughter Friedman.

&quot;My mother is a survivor. She had several miscarriages, internal bleeding and cancer. She and her father had cancer but she got over the disease while he couldn&#39;t.&quot;

More than 100 years have passed since she experienced the first pandemic of her life in 1918, Ms. Friedman is now diagnosed with Covid-19.

Ms. Friedman lives in a nursing home in Westchester County, relatively close to New York City - the epicenter of Covid-19 in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), older people and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions are those at high risk of developing a serious condition if they have Covid- 19, especially those in nursing homes.

The doctors kept Mrs. Friedman in the hospital for a week before she returned to the nursing home and isolated herself in the room. After a few weeks of fever, she tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 last week.

&quot;She is not a human being. She has the superman&#39;s DNA,&quot; Merola said.

To reduce the risk of the disease, CDC recommends that Americans stay home as much as possible, regularly washing their hands, and maintaining at least 2 meters physical distance from others.

To date, the United States has recorded more than 1 million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 60,000 deaths from the disease, of which New York is the state with the most cases with more than 295,000 cases, and more than 22,000 deaths.
