Staff members install artificial nests on an electricity pylon in Wenchang, south China's Hainan Province, April 23, 2020. With a mild climate, Hainan is a paradise for birds. Especially from March to July each year, the breeding season for birds, a large number of birds nest and lay eggs. As the transmission lines usually pass through wetlands, ponds and fields where birds flock, electricity pylons become their ideal places to nest.
   To allow birds and cables to co-exist in harmony, Hainan Power Grid Company changed its traditional way of repelling birds and has been attracting and protecting birds by offering homes for them. About 3,000 artificial nests have been installed on the transmission lines over the past three years. (Xinhua/Pu Xiaoxu)
