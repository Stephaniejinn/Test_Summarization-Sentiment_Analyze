Original title: US media reveals that US right-wing forces distribute new crown virus conspiracy theory for political motive
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 1 (Xinhua) The US media recently revealed that American right-wing forces deliberately spread the conspiracy theory that the &quot;new crown virus originated from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute&quot; for political motives.
The US &quot;buzz feed&quot; news website recently published a survey article entitled &quot;Scientists have not found evidence of the new corona virus leaking from the Wuhan laboratory, and Trump supporters are spreading rumors without any worries.&quot; Supporters and anti-China forces passed on the contradiction for political purposes and spread the new crown virus from the conspiracy theory of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute.
The article describes the evolution of the conspiracy theory that framed the Wuhan Virus Research Institute in the past 4 months: First, the US zero-right financial news site &quot;Zero Hedge&quot; rumored that a scientist at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute created the new crown virus; later the US right wing radio host pulled Shi Limbo falsely accused the deep-rooted country of making the new crown virus as a political weapon to “defeat Trump”; soon, Republican Senator Coton claimed that the virus might be a laboratory-made biological weapon; by early April, there was anti-China The video released by the media framed the New Crown Virus as an artificial virus derived from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. Since then, conspiracy theories of virus origins have “entered the mainstream of American conservative forces”, and Fox News Network and Washington Post columnist Luo Jin have intensified their efforts to promote such conspiracy theories.
The article concludes that this conspiracy theory &quot;is in the interests of Trump and his supporters because it helps these people easily find the scapegoat for the epidemic.&quot;
The article quoted Lacaniero, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, as saying that &quot;the laboratory is the source of the virus&quot; is &quot;purely politically driven.&quot; &quot;The virus can never be leaked in the laboratory, otherwise (all researchers) should have fallen ill ... no one can design this virus.&quot;
The article also quoted Corningick, a senior policy researcher at the US think tank Global Development Center, as saying that the Trump administration has worked very hard to find a direct link between the new coronavirus and Chinese laboratories, but they have found nothing so far. &quot;At present, there is no evidence that the virus originated in the laboratory-either intentionally or accidentally leaked.&quot;
