Title : Canadian Forces Snowbirds launch cross-Canada tour
Ariticle : 
April 29, 2020 – Moose Jaw, SK – National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces
The Canadian Forces Snowbirds will cross the country to salute Canadians doing their part to fight the spread of COVID-19.  This unique mission is being aptly dubbed Operation INSPIRATION.
The team’s signature nine-jet formation, with trailing white smoke, will fly over cities across the country starting in Nova Scotia this weekend and working west throughout the week. The team will release anticipated locations, routes, and times on their social media platforms each day. Flyovers will occur at an elevation no lower than 500 feet above all obstacles.   
The team will be practicing recommended hand-washing and wearing recommended personal protective equipment while travelling. Team members will also be minimizing any interactions with people outside of the team.
We encourage Canadians to observe the flyovers from the safety of their home and refrain from travelling to see the flyovers. Please maintain physical distancing practices that are keeping us all safe.
