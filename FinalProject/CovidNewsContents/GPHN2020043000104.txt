Ariticle : 
Ten new local coronavirus cases were reported Tuesday, according to the Department of Health.
Health officials reported there were 218 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Louisiana, bringing the number to 27,286. There were 1,758 deaths reported across the state, an increase of 61 from Monday.
There were three new coronavirus cases reported in Lafourche, from 632 to 635. Deaths remained at 39. However, Lafourche President Archie Chaisson said Tuesday the state uses zip codes to compile its data which leads to overlapping with neighboring parishes. Lafourche actually has 463 cases so far, he said.
Health officials reported seven new cases in Terrebonne, from 375 to 382. Both state and parish officials reported 31 deaths in Terrebonne, which is an increase of one from Monday.
Statewide hospitalizations decreased by 17 on Tuesday, health officials said.
The Department of Health reported there were 1,666 patients being hospitalized with the virus and three fewer using ventilators. Ventilator usage fell from 262 to 244. There were 350 patients in Lafourche who processed state lab tests and 2,520 were given commercial tests. There were 193 state lab tests processed in Terrebonne and 2,112 commercial tests.
There were 7,567 state lab tests processed across the state and 143,541 commercial tests. The Department of Health revised its test figures down Friday after an investigation determined there was an error in the initial numbers.
According to state findings that were updated Monday, Lafourche reports 51% of the COVID deaths are black and 49% white. However, blacks make up only 14% of the parish's population.
Terrebonne reports 54% of the deaths were black and 46% were white. Blacks make up 19% of Terrebonne's overall population.
The New York Times recently ranked the Houma-Thibodaux area as sixth in the nation for decreasing new coronavirus cases. Using data compiled from Lafourche and Terrebonne, the Houma-Thibodaux area reported 428 new cases a week ago, but that number fell to 266 this week, the paper reported.
All 64 parishes have reported at least one confirmed coronavirus case.
Health officials said there are 14,927 people who have recovered from the virus across the state, which remained unchanged from the weekend. Officials said the number of recoveries would be updated later this week. Health officials listed 61 cases that have not yet been assigned to a specific parish and remain under investigation.
