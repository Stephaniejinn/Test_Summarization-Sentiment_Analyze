The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 27,682, the agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. 
The number of officially confirmed cases, which includes those who have died and recovered, amounts to 203,591, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain. 
People registered as currently carrying the illness declined to 104,657 from 105,205 on Tuesday. 
There were 1,795 people in intensive care on Wednesday against a previous 1,863, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 71,252 were declared recovered against 68,941 a day earlier.
