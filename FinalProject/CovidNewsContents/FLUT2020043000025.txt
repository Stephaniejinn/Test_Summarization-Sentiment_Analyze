Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to 
new death statistics
 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official 
counts
 of deaths from the coronavirus.
