Original title: White House consultants rashly say &quot;China provides fake and inferior test kits to the United States&quot;, Hua Chunying lists facts to fight back
[Overseas Net April 29 | Wartime Epidemic Time Zone] White House trade adviser Navarro recently threw the fallacy of &quot;China provides counterfeit and shoddy test kits&quot; and also slandered &quot;the Chinese side hoards medical supplies to make huge profits.&quot; In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying cited the facts on Twitter on the 29th to fight back.
&quot;The famous Navarro said? Fake test kit? Collect personal protective equipment?&quot; Hua Chunying sent three questions in a tweet, and then she listed the relevant facts to fight back. &quot;China and the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) has maintained good communication and cooperation to ensure that the exported materials meet the quality standards of the United States. From March 1 to April 24, China has provided about 3.5 billion masks, 300 million gloves and more than 5,800 breaths to the United States machine.&quot;
Hua Chunying also attached a related report published by Reuters on the 28th, and marked some of the reports in red. According to this report, in an interview on the 27th, Navarro claimed that China &quot;hide the epidemic&quot;, slandered China for &quot;providing a low-quality or even counterfeit new coronavirus test kit to the United States,&quot; and even discredited that &quot;China is worldwide The personal protective equipment needed by the medical staff inside is profitable in today&#39;s circumstances. &quot;
In this tweet by Hua Chunying, some netizens tweeted to the United States that &quot;please stop the stupid performance&quot; and pointed out that &quot;China has always been conscientious.&quot;
Some netizens believe that &quot;it is the customary selfishness, arrogance and prejudice in the West that has led to today&#39;s runaway situation.&quot;
Some netizens commented that “China has made tremendous sacrifices to contain the epidemic and spared no effort to help other countries. What the world&#39;s superpowers (referring to the United States) have done is to defame and blame others. It is a world apart.”
In response to Navalo&#39;s so-called smearing remarks against China, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said on the 28th that Navarro&#39;s remarks were unfounded and extremely irresponsible. Since the outbreak of the international epidemic, China has maintained good communication and cooperation with the certification and registration agencies of various countries including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the export of anti-epidemic materials meets the quality requirements of importers. At present, China has exported tens of millions of copies of the New Coronavirus test kit, which has been widely praised by the international community. China has not yet received any feedback from the US purchasers and users about the quality of the test kit.
