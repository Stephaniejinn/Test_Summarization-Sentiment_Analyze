Ariticle : 
In Mexico, the number of cases of people infected with COVID-19 increased to 22,088 confirmed patients, the Ministry of Health (SSa) reported on Saturday. The death toll grew to 2,061.
Hugo López-Gatell, undersecretary of prevention and health promotion, said this Saturday through a video posted on his social networks that after reviewing the epidemiological report of COVID-19, the number of contagioes in Mexico is being reduced, so he appreciated the coordination of governors in all states.
"We are flattening the curve and it is being achieved in each of the states. This is very important because it shows how we are well organized," he said.
Between May 6 and 10, it is expected to be the peak of contagion by the coronavirus pandemic in the valley of Mexico, according to the study-based projection of the Center for Mathematical Research and the Institute of Mathematics of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
This was reported this Friday by López-Gatell during the press conference on COVID-19 in Palacio Nacional. However, it clarified that, despite this prediction, health measures should not be relaxed, as they could cause a res upstick in the region.
