Close-up of advanced technology series against Covid-19 at Hong Kong airport


Hong Kong International Airport recently installed a full-body disinfection chamber, to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is known that this is also the first airport in the world to use this system.

Before entering the disinfection chamber, the user will have his body temperature measured. The disinfection process will be conducted within 40 seconds. By applying multiple disinfection methods at the same time, this system will completely eliminate pathogens on the body, clothes of users in less than 1 minute. Besides, like other modern sterilization chambers, the space inside this chamber always maintains negative pressure, in order to limit the possibility of cross-contamination. According to representatives of Hong Kong International Airport, the sterilization chamber is currently restricted to employees having direct contact with passengers.


In addition to the disinfection chamber, the airport is also deploying antibacterial coating on frequently exposed surfaces such as kiosks, check-in desks, toilets, seats, transit vehicles. This invisible coating has been declared as capable of killing germs such as bacteria and viruses. The test of the coating will take place by the end of May. After that, based on the efficiency, the airport management will decide whether to continue the long-term use or not.


Along with that, Hong Kong International Airport is also deploying additional automated robots, capable of simultaneously using UV and gaseous disinfectant to clean important areas.
