Title : Malawi: Story Workshop Engages Community Leaders On COVID-19 Myths
Ariticle : 
The Story Workshop Educational Trust (Swet) project manager Ambere Gogwe has said coronavirus (Covid-19) myths and misconceptions are posing a threat to the fight against the pandemic.
Ambere Gogwe: Swet is using experts to brief community leaders to disseminate correct Covid-19 information.
Speaking in Mchinji during the training of community leaders on the pandemic, she said with funding from GIZ, they have embarked on a campaign to train key players in the fight against the pandemic by giving them correct information.
Gogwe said Swet is using experts from the ministries of Health, Gender and Social Welfare, Education and Information to brief community leaders to disseminate correct Covid-19 information.
"Some of the misconceptions are that coronavirus is not real. Again, some people are saying anti-retroviral drugs [ARVs] can heal Covid-19 while others are saying it is a political move so that they should not vote in the fresh presidential election," she said.
In his remarks, Traditional Authority Kazyozyo said the training helped community leaders to come up with prevention measures against the pandemic.
"We have come up with action plans to be used at funerals, chieftaincy installation, religious gatherings and other places where people come together," he said. The chief warned his subjects against secretly keeping immigrants who recently visited countries which have also registered Covid-19 cases.
