The Spanish government announced on Thursday that it will set slots to allow limited departures to its citizens from Saturday, on a day in which the country announced its lowest number of daily deaths since March 20.According to the Ministry of Health, Spain recorded 268 new deaths, bringing the death total to 24,543, the fourth highest balance in the world behind the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom.The country has remained in the last five days around 300 deaths a day, away from the death toll in early April, when 950 deaths were recorded in 24 hours.All this occurs after seven weeks of severe confinement, during which the Spaniards could only leave to work if it was not possible to do it from home or for basic activities such as buying food or medicines or walking the dog.

These restrictions, decreed on 14 March, began to relax the previous weekend, with the authorization of departures for children under 14 years of age for one hour a day.Celebrating that the country is "achieving its objectives", Health Minister Salvador Illa confirmed the new "relief measures" planned for Saturday: the possibility of going out to do sports individually or walking with a person living under the same roof.But, to avoid the accumulation of people who were seen on the first day of departure of children, the ministry established different slots for these departures in the municipalities of more than 5000 inhabitants.Adults who want to walk or play sports will be able to do so at two daily intervals, while older adults will be reserved for differentiated stripes, just like children."It's about ordering the day a little bit so there's as little agglomeration as possible," the minister said.In Barcelona, to increase the space available to pedestrians, they decided to open 70 closed public parks since the beginning of confinement and ban traffic in a street quarantine.
Effects on the economySince the government they claim that the epidemic remains under control and highlight the results of confinement."We started it on March 14th with 35% contagious numbers (on a daily increase), today we are at 0.6%," said the Head of Health.According to his ministry, confirmed cases of the new coronavirus exceed 213,000, while the number of people who have cured the disease is more than 112,000.The restrictions left a major invoice. In the first quarter, GDP sank by 5.2% and the unemployment rate rose to 14.4%.In addition, almost 4 million people are suspended from the temporary cessation of business.Spanish president, Socialist Pedro Sanchez, on Tuesday announced a plan for a "progressive" deconfundion of the population that will be done by "phases" and should end by "end of June" if the epidemic evolves favorably.The plan envisages a very gradual reopening with limited capacity in sectors of activity such as catering or hospitality, which strongly criticized the government strategy.
