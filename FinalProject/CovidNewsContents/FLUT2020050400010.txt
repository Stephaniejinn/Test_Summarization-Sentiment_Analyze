							Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which invades a cell through binding to the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 priming. Patients with severe disease predominantly present with pneumonia-related symptoms. However, evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection also has implications for the urogenital tract. Thus, urogenital organs should be considered when treating COVID-19.

Most patients with severe COVID-19 present with pneumonia-related symptoms, but some patients with severe disease could develop serious urinary complications including acute kidney injury (AKI), which requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)

. Furthermore, male reproductive systems are vulnerable to infection; dramatic changes in sex hormones in patients with COVID-19 have been observed, suggesting gonadal function impairment

. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 impairs the urogenital system and learning from previous experience of managing these complications are of great importance for proper treatment and rehabilitation planning.
