WINDHOEK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China Harbour Engineering Company has donated some 2,000 food packages worth about 500,000 Namibian dollars (about 28,000 U.S. dollars) to disadvantaged Namibians who are struggling to make ends meet during the lockdown period amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
Speaking about the donation, Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila commended the donation, saying the outbreak is uniting nations worldwide to assist each other in this difficult time.
Representative of China Harbour Engineering Company Zhang Bing said the epidemic has no borders and is an enemy to human beings.
"We will gather greater strength and we will surely achieve a full victory. A friend in need is a friend indeed," Zhang said, adding that the friendship between the two peoples will be deepened.
The food parcels included canned fish, meat, maize meal, flour and sugar, and were delivered early this week.
