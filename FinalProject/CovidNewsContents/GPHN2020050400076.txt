Ariticle : 
BELGRADE, Serbia. May 3 (Interfax) - Russian specialists in Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection (RKhBZ) have disinfected one of the largest cancer treatment centers in the Balkans, the Institute for Oncology and Radiology in Belgrade, the Russian Defense Ministry told Interfax.
The institute has a normal daily admission capacity of over 2,000 patients and eight laboratories for X-ray treatment of around 700 patients, the ministry said.
"Due to the spread of the coronavirus the number of admissions was decreased to limit contact among people, but the institute cannot stop working because too many lives depend on it," the statement reads.
Given its significance, the Russian chemical troops have disinfected the institute for a second time now, the ministry said.
"We have not stopped our work, we must work with cancer patients throughout the pandemic. The Russian troops were very helpful. Without them, without their work the situation around the novel coronavirus at the institute would have been considerably worse!" the institute's director Prof. Danica Grujicic said.
Also, Russian RKhBZ troops jointly with their Serbian counterparts disinfected 20 sites in Belgrade, Prokop and Blace in a 24-hour span.
Two medical nurse brigades participated in the examination and treatment of 14 Covid-19 patients at a hospital in Nis. The Russian medics assessed and analyzed the epidemiological situation and gave recommendations on anti-epidemic measures at medical facilities in Alibunar, Trstenik, Tutin and Ivanjica.
In all, the Russian military group in Serbia has disinfected 154 facilities in 30 Serbian towns and cities, including over 323 buildings and structures over more than 1.41 million square meters and 65 paved roads with a total area of around 470,000 square meters. Military medics examined and participated in treating over 785 Covid-19 patients.
