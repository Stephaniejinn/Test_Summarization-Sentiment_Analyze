According to a Reuters report on April 27th, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires hand sanitizer manufacturers to add modified alcohol to hand sanitizer products to make the hand sanitizer taste worse, so as to prevent people, especially Children drink hand sanitizer.
FDA Director Stephen Hahn issued a statement that said: &quot;There is no evidence that the hand sanitizer can kill the new coronavirus. Like all external products, the hand sanitizer cannot be drunk or injected.&quot; The statement requires the hand sanitizer manufacturer to add modified alcohol to the product. Makes the taste of the hand sanitizer bitter so that consumers will not want to drink it.
The FDA also recommends that manufacturers of hand sanitizers add warning messages for children to their products and instructions on how to seek medical attention if they are used incorrectly.
Last week, President Trump declared that he could consider injecting disinfectant into his body and cleaning his lungs with disinfectant. This remark caused concern that people may blindly use disinfection products and may poison themselves.
Since the outbreak of the New Crown epidemic in the United States, there has been a surge in the demand for hand sanitizers in the United States, and many poisoning incidents have occurred. The FDA said that compared with March 2019, the number of phone calls related to hand sanitizers to the National Toxic Data System of the United States increased by 79% last month, most of them involving children aged 5 and under.
