Badminton's Thomas & Uber Cups have been postponed again to between Oct. 3-11 following the restriction measures imposed by the Danish government to contain the COVID-19 outbreak
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Badminton's Thomas & Uber Cups have been postponed again to between Oct. 3-11 following the restriction measures imposed by the Danish government to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Badminton World Federation said on Wednesday.
The events were initially scheduled for May 16-24 in Aarhus, Denmark, but were postponed to Aug. 15-23 due to the spread of COVID-19.
However, the announcement by the Danish government in early April to ban all larger gatherings in the country until the end of August had made holding the championships before September unfeasible, the world governing body of badminton said in a statement.
The BWF, in consultation and consensus with Badminton Denmark as well as other stakeholders, concluded that a move to October was the best solution, the statement said.

"Our main priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of athletes, staff, volunteers, judges and the entire badminton community," said BWF Secretary General Thomas Lund.
"We listened to the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO), various health experts, local authorities and the Danish Government and it became clear that hosting a big event like the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals before September would be difficult."
"We are confident that we can stage a safe and successful championships on the new dates of 3-11 October while all the time monitoring the situation closely should things change again," Lund added.
BWF added that solutions for the BWF AGM 2020 and Members' Forum are also being considered. Both events were due to take place in Aarhus during the week of the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals.
