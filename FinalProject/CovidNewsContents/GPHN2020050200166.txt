Analysis of city Department of Health (DOH) and Staten Island hospital data over the nearly eight-week course of the borough's coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak shows that three key indicators all reflect a slow decline in the outbreak's intensity during the most recent two weeks.
The daily rate of new confirmed cases has decreased in recent days, the net change of deaths has dropped and the curve of total hospitalizations on the borough is on the decline.
The first confirmed Staten Island COVID-19 case was reported by the Advance/SILive.com on March 9.
As of Tuesday night, positive cases tallied 11,635 on the borough and confirmed cases reached 159,865 citywide Tuesday night the Advance/SILive.com reported.
While cases continue to increase, according to graphs created by the Advance/SILive.com, the number of daily new cases on the borough has decreased significantly since April 9 — when more than one thousand new positive tests were reported on the borough.
From the high-point of 1,196 new cases reported on April 9, only 115 new cases were reported on the borough on Tuesday, data shows.
Even compared to April 18, when 341 new cases of the virus were reported on Staten Island, the trend of new cases is generally pointing downwards.
While increasing slightly between Monday and Tuesday, the overall curve of daily new cases has generally sunk over the past 20 days.
The number of total coronavirus deaths on Staten Island has reached 726 as New York City's death total surpassed 17,500, according to Tuesday night's DOH data.
A total of 588 are confirmed to have died on Staten Island as a result of the virus, and an additional 138 are deemed probable cases.
A death is classified as "probable" if the person had no known positive laboratory test for the coronavirus, but had exhibited symptoms and has a death certificate listing "COVID-19" or an equivalent as the cause.
While the grim totals continue to crawl upward, the daily increases of deaths on the borough have sank in recent days.
Significantly down from the April 13 total of 65, the latest daily increase of 16 deaths shows the coronavirus loosening its grip on Staten Island.
And when looked at another way, there were 14 daily COVID-19 deaths on Staten Island, on average, April 26 to April 28. During the 10 previous days, 25 people died from the disease on average, every day — showing that borough deaths could be down more than 50%.
Despite the hopeful signs, the downward progression of the deaths curve has been slow and arduous, ticking down from 16 to 11 between April 26 and April 27 before climbing back up to 16 on Tuesday.
Hospitalizations across Staten Island's two medical systems appear to be on the downward side of the curve — currently standing at 336 total confirmed coronavirus hospitalizations, compared to the peak of 554 on April 8.
Seen over the past month, hospitalizations have been steadily falling, with hospitalizations dropping by 102 patients between April 8 and April 15, and then dropping by 63 from April 15 to April 22.
Since then, hospitalizations hit their lowest point since the peak of the outbreak when 334 patients were being treated on April 26. Hospitalization levels had not seen those levels since before March 31.
In recent days, hospitalizations saw a slight uptick between April 26 and April 27, before turning back down on Wednesday.
As of Wednesday, more than 100 patients remained in critical care across both Staten Island University Hospital campuses. An additional 50 were in the ICU at Richmond University Medical Center.
