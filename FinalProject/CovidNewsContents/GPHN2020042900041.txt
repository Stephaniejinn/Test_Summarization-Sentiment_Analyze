After ending quarantine due to the pandemic of the novel coronavirus, cruise ship Costa Fascinosa, of Italy’s Costa Crociere, is expected to complete another step disembarking crew members
 today 
(Apr. 28
).
According Brazil’s sanitation watchdog Anvisa, some 230 people should leave the vessel.
In a note, Anvisa reports that all in the group will be submitted to clinical tests for COVID-19 symptoms. New tests will be run for diagnosis only if required by the target country.
As it stands today, 242 crew members are aboard the ship. 
On March 17, when the vessel moored at São Paulo’s Santos port, there were no passengers left in the ship.
Costa Fascinosa arrived at the port with a 764-people crew. On April 5, a group of 75 Brazilian crew members disembarked. Six days later, 227 Filipino members were allowed to leave for their country on a chartered flight.
From March 19 to April 26, the ship was on quarantine, which did not end until no COVID-19 cases were found on board.
In the period, 30 COVID-19 infections were confirmed, 20 of which with a quick test, and ten with hospital care outside of the ship. Of those who landed for emergency care, three showed severe symptoms and died.
