Nearly 3,000 crew members of a cruise ship from tourism giant TUI, docked in a port in northern Germany, were quarantined on board after one of them tested positive for the new coronavirus, the company announced this Friday.
According to the group, fifteen crew members of the ship "Mein Schiff 3" were tested after having exhibited mild flu symptoms and one of them tested positive for COVID-19.
The 15 sailors were placed in isolation aboard the ship, which is docked at The port of Cuxhaven, near the North Sea.
All 2,899 crew members will remain on board in quarantine "until further notice," TUI said in a statement.
Some crew members, who had disembarked, as the ship arrived in port on Tuesday, were called back on board, the company added, which noted that no passengers were on the ship.
