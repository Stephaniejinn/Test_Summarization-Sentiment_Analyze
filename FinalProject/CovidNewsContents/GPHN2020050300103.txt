Title : County's new COVID-19 reports detail cases, deaths Reports
Ariticle : 
Warren County has begun releasing twice-weekly data reports on cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus illness.
Slated to come out on Tuesdays and Fridays, the Warren County Health Department reports detail the numbers of confirmed cases and where they're occurring, as well as the demographics of who has fallen ill and data on fatalities. All 22 municipalities have seen cases of the viral disease.
For example, of 878 confirmed cases listed in the first report on Tuesday, 303 (34.5%) were in long-term care facilities. Of 80 COVID-19-related deaths reported to the department, 62 (77.5%) are associated with one of the county's seven such facilities.
The youngest person to have been confirmed to have COVID-19 was 7 months; the oldest was 102 years. The youngest person to have died was 41, with the 102-year-old representing the oldest.
About one in four cases (26%) have resulted in hospitalization, with 7% requiring treatment in intensive care.
"As cases are reported to the Warren County Health Department, they are investigated as quickly as possible," Tuesday's report states. "Cases are interviewed about their symptoms, risk factors and close contacts, including their place of employment
and coworkers when applicable."
An average of 32 new cases per day have been reported in the past seven days, according to the Tuesday report.
By comparison, across the Delaware River in Northampton County, there were 1,970 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday â€” including 136 new cases in the past 24 hours. Northampton County reported 80 deaths, 72 of whom were county residents and eight who lived elsewhere.
Northampton County offers an information dashboard about its COVID-19 data at northampton.maps.arcgis.com. Bethlehem, which has its own health department, offers a similar dashboard at bethlehem-pa.maps.arcgis.com.
