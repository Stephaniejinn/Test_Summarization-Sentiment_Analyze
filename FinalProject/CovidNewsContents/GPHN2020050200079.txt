Title : Quebec launches COVID-19 testing blitz days before partial reopening
Ariticle : 
Quebec is ramping up its COVID-19 testing to be able to collect samples from as many as 14,000 people a day even as the province allows some stores outside of Montreal to reopen on Monday.
The goal of the testing program is to get a clearer picture of the transmission of the pandemic coronavirus not only in hospitals and nursing homes, but in the community as well, Quebec’s chief public health officer said at a news conference on Friday.
“We’re testing to find positive cases, identify their contacts, follow up on the chain of transmission, and we will isolate those affected to avoid the spread of the virus,” Dr. Horacio Arruda said.
To date, Arruda noted Quebec has been carrying out 6,000 tests a day, although the government’s own figures from the last two weeks show a range of 3,000 to 5,000. Last week, Arruda said Quebec would ultimately have the capacity to perform up to 30,000 tests.
Public health authorities will also be carrying out a more thorough investigation of outbreaks in Montreal North, the city’s new COVID-19 hot spot. Arruda added that some of the information gleaned will likely include the socio-economic and racial characteristics of the people of Montreal North, with the cooperation of community leaders. Montreal North has about 13 per cent of residents born in Haiti.

Arruda unveiled details of the testing program as Quebec crossed the 2,000 threshold in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Quebec’s mortality total stands at 2,022, almost double the number in the rest of Canada combined: 1,364.
Premier François Legault, who did not attend Friday’s briefing, has said Quebec counts its deaths differently than other provinces and includes fatalities where COVID-19 is presumed to be the cause.
Meanwhile, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quebec reached 28,648, up by 1,110. Of that number, 1,716 were being treated for the respiratory illness in hospital.
