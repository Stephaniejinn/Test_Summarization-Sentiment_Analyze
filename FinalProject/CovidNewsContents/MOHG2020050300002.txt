​The Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), is conducting an advanced multicenter clinical study at seven hospitals in the Kingdom to stop the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These hospitals are King Faisal Specialist Hospital, King Saudi University Medical City, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital -Riyadh, Uhud Hospital-Madinah, Al-Noor Specialist Hospital-Makkah, Dammam Central Hospital, and Al-Qatif Central Hospital.
The study, which is being conducted by a team of physicians, pharmacists and researchers, aims to evaluate four drug therapy protocols, including Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Remedisivir, and Interferon. 
It is noted that these drugs, administered in different ways (e.g. orally and intravenously), have antiviral properties, or simulate some methods of immune response to viruses. Also, the study targets patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Some of these drugs have demonstrated initial efficacy in laboratory studies.
The Researches and Study General Department pointed out that the study has been launched today, May 2nd, 2020 (corresponding to Ramadan 9th, 1441H.), meanwhile some confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been hospitalized.
It is worth mentioning that this study comes in continuation of MOH’s efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the new medicines through clinical experiments, and search for an effective vaccine, with the unstinting support of the government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, May Allah protect him, which has spared no effort to maintain the health and safety of citizens and residents of this gracious Kingdom.
