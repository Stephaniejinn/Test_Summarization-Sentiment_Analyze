Title : US airport workers hit with layoffs amid COVID-19 outbreak
Ariticle : 
Many airport workers in US have been laid off until people start flying again and airports return to how they were before the coronavirus pandemic.
With most flights grounded, low-paid airport workers across the United States have been hit hard by layoffs.
Before the pandemic, they were fighting for a pay increase.
Now, those who remain, are facing years of financial hardship.
