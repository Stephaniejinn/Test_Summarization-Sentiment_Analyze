The Massachusetts Department of Health reported an additional 1,963 COVID-19 cases and 252 deaths today, bringing the state totals to 60,265 confirmed cases and 3,405 deaths.
According to the Boston Public Health Commission, the states’s largest city has seen 9284 cases and more than 300 deaths.
In Holyoke, Massachusetts, WCVB 5 reports some 70 veterans have died since the beginning of the pandemic at the Holyoke Soldiers Home–the deadliest known outbreak at a long-term care facility in the U.S.
Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive.
In late March, the superintendent of the Soldiers’ Home was put on paid administrative leave after information about the death of 11 veterans and the COVID-19 outbreak at the facility was released.
The state has since deployed the National Guard to assist at the facility and both the state and federal authorities have launched separate investigations into the deaths and virus outbreak at the Soldiers’ Home.
