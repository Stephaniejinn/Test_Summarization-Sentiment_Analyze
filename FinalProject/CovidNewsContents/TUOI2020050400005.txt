Lawyer Truong Thanh Duc:

Need to clarify the possibility of profiteering
After all, electronic bidding or centralized bidding is still the deciding factor. Contractors are always for profit and always want to raise the highest price. And state agencies must always be supervisors.
Purchase of COVID-19 testing machines with taxpayers&#39; money, the state management agency must supervise. Actual purchase price depends on the efficiency of the machine.
So to have accurate prices, the state agencies must be alert. As for the phenomenon of increasing the price of testing machines simultaneously, in my opinion, with the current bidding law framework, it is still necessary to expect the morality of the representatives of state agencies who buy equipment.
Need to clarify whether or not signs of profiteering by local officials in this case.
