Ariticle : 
May 5, 2020 – Laval, Québec – Correctional Service Canada
On May 3, 2020, an inmate from the Federal Training Centre, multi-level unit, in Laval, died as an apparent result of complications related to COVID-19.
The inmate’s next of kin have been notified of their death. Correctional Service Canada (CSC) extends its condolences to the family.
As in all cases involving the death of an inmate, CSC has notified the coroner who will review the circumstances of the death.
CSC has dedicated health services and medical professionals in all of its institutions. We also work closely and collaboratively with local public health partners and hospitals to provide complete and quality medical care to those who need it and to prevent further spread of COVID-19.
This is the second death related to COVID-19 among federally sentenced inmates. CSC provides regular 
updates
 on COVID-19 tests and cases among federal offenders in institutions.
The Privacy Act allows CSC to release certain information at the time of a death in custody. To provide transparency during this pandemic, CSC is disclosing the deaths linked to COVID-19 while respecting privacy and the protection of personal information by not disclosing the name of the inmate or their personal medical details.
