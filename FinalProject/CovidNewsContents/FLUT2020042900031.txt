Abstract

Acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood (ANEC) is a disease, characterized by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, accompanied with fever, rapid alteration of consciousness, and seizures. The clinical characteristics of ANEC include acute encephalopathy following a viral infection, seizure, altered consciousness, and absence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, with an occasional increase in the level of proteins. This disease is almost exclusively seen in previously healthy infants and children from East Asia. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations have demonstrated symmetric lesions involving the thalami, brainstem, cerebellum, and white matter. ANEC has a poor prognosis with high morbidity and mortality rates. Herein, we present three cases of ANEC, who were referred to Bu-Ali Hospital of Ardabil, Iran during two weeks. Report of these three cases promoted the idea of an epidemic. The purpose of this case series was to raise the issue that ANEC may occur as an epidemic.
