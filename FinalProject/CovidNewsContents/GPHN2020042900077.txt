Title : 13-year-old tests positive in Bengaluru
Ariticle : 
Karnataka recorded two deaths on Monday. A 50-year-old Covid-19 positive patient committed suicide in Bengaluru and another patient died in Kalaburagi. The 57-year-old person from Aland, Kalaburagi, was tested positive on April 21 and got admitted to Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences with respiratory problems. Sources said he was also suffering from severe liver-related ailments. With this, the total deaths in Kalaburagi went up to five, making it a total of 20 death cases in Karnataka.
Meanwhile, nine new cases were reported in the state, thereby taking the total tally to 512. In Bengaluru, a 13-year old from Padarayanapura, who was suffering from Influenza like illness (ILI), has tested positive. This case has puzzled health officials as he had no contact with any of the Covid-19 patients. Now, experts are tracing if the boy had come in contact with any patient. It is also said that his parents have tested negative.
Eleven Covid-19 patients got discharged, with total discharges now rising from 182 to 193. Two cases were reported from Mangaluru. Out of this, one patient came in contact with another COVID-19 patient in a hospital and got infected.
