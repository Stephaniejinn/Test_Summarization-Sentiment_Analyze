Title : Are covid-19 drugs effective?
Ariticle : 
There are currently several tests with drugs to combat the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes covid-19 disease, these drugs, which have not yet been approved by any local health authority or in the world, may have some reactions in our body due to their side effects.
Jorge Alcocer Varela, Secretary of Health, reported during press conference on the state of coronavirus in the country which drugs are being studied and that could help fight covid-19, a disease that has left more than a thousand people dead in the country.
m{797642}The Health Secretary commented that there are currently four drugs that are being tested to fight coronavirus in the country: remdesivir, liponavir and ritonavil, hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab.
m{797640}According to Alcocer Varela, to prevent the virus from replicating in our cells and that we do not have in one day a million copies, liponavir and ritonavil, which are two molecules that have been used in other viral infections in another time, act in the Golgi apparatus of our cells, where SARS-CoV2 reproduces. Remdesivir acts the same way.
m{797641}"It also has an action there and this is novel, it is one of the most driven, you who quickly see Dr. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health of the United States, announced that there is improvement with this drug, already through China had been done a study in a few patients and now were in a few hundred patients who conclude that there are no great advances , except that in the place of having 12 days of hospital stay is reduced to 10," he reported.While hydroxychloroquine has a more peripheral action, like tocilizumab, which is an antibody that will slow down what is occurring elsewhere where great inflammation is being caused.
"One of the molecules is called cytosine, some call it a cytosine storm, there are 20, 30 that are occurring in different inflammatory diseases, mainly rheumatic, but in this case the LI6 which has been used because it has also shown poor results," he said.Why are there no medications yet?Jorge Alcocer explained that the drugs being tested are experiences of other diseases and in other times, but that so far there is no drug that fights coronavirus.
"Technologically we have many possibilities, but it is not that there is impossibility, but to locate what this virus neutralizes and of course eliminate it early, that is more complicated," he said.bgpa
