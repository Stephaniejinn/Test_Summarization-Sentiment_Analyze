Indiana's number of positive cases statewide rose by 645 for a total of 19,933 on Sunday with 17 new deaths reported, according to the ISDH's coronavirus dashboard.
There have now been 1,132 deaths in the state related to COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the current coronavirus. In addition, the ISDH lists another 114 probable deaths. Those are cases when a physician lists COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death but there are no positive test results recorded.
Vanderburgh County remains at one death.
In Warrick County, there have been 16 deaths, according to county health officials. Warrick County's remained at 101 positive cases, according to the ISDH. However, Warrick County's coronavirus dashboard, updated at 7 p.m. Saturday, indicated 99.

Fourteen of Warrick County's deaths are of long-term care residents, including 12 at Signature HealthCARE in Newburgh and two at Hamilton Pointe. A nurse at Signature died Friday, although that death will be counted in Spencer County, officials said.
Two deaths from the general public have been attributed to COVID-19 in Warrick County as of Sunday morning.
