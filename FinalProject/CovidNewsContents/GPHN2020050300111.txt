Ariticle : 
Officials on Friday confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in an inmate at a Maricopa County Jail.
The Maricopa County Correctional Health Services and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office confirmed the positive case of coronavirus occurred with an inmate arrested on April 26.
During an intake screening, the person complained of a sore throat and cough. The individual was given a face mask and placed in an isolation cell, according to a statement released by the county.
The inmate was then transferred to a Medical Observation Housing Unit and tested for COVID-19, the statement said.
The inmate was released from jail on Wednesday while the test result was pending. The individual was advised to continue isolating and seek medical help if symptoms of fever, shortness of breath or cough worsened, the county said.
The test result came back positive for COVID-19 a day after the release.
Officials were working to track and contact anyone the individual came into contact with, and identify MCSO staff who came in contact with the person.
The statement did not specify which jail facility was involved or whether the person involved was a man or woman.
As of Friday, 123 inmates from Maricopa County jails have been tested. Of those tests, 107 have been confirmed negative and 15 inmates are in isolation with results pending, the statement added.
