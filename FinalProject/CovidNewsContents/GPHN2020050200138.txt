PORT CLINTON â€“ Six weeks after the first local case of COVID-19 was confirmed, Ottawa County has reported its first death as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Friday, the Ottawa County Health Department confirmed that a 75-year-old local woman had died due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
According to a news release, the health department is not reporting any additional information about the victim out of respect for the woman and her family's privacy.
"The Ottawa County Health Department along with our community partners would like to express great sympathy to the family and friends of this patient, we understand this is a difficult time for you," the release stated. "We have been working very hard to keep the residents of Ottawa County healthy and informed during this public health emergency."
The department urged people to continue taking measures to protect themselves from the virus, such as social distancing, washing hands for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, avoiding those that are sick and staying home if you are sick.
As of Friday, there are now 40 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa County, 26 women and 14 men, according to the Ohio Department of Health.
Cases in the county jumped significantly in mid-April, including a one-day increase of 10 from 19 on Tuesday, April 14, to 29 on Wednesday, April 15, and then by another four up to 33 on Thursday, April 16.
The increase of cases then began to steady to about one or two every few days up to the current total of 40.
According to the Ottawa County Emergency Management Agency, that jump in local cases reported in mid-April was primarily due to an outbreak within a congregate living facility.
The name of the facility has not been released, but Ottawa County Commissioner Mark Stahl said the outbreak at that one facility accounted for about half of the county's total cases.
The Ottawa County Health Department also noted that the statewide "Stay Safe Ohio" order from Ohio Health Director Amy Acton has been extended through May 29 and stressed the importance to keep those safety requirements in mind during the "Responsible RestartOhio" plan recently released by Gov. Mike DeWine and other state leaders.
Statewide, Ohio has had 18,743 cases of COVID-19, with 1,002 deaths as of 2 p.m. Friday based on statistics combining the state's reported cases and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's "probable" case findings.
