Title : In open, transparent manner, China winning war against COVID-19
Ariticle : 


China is winning its war against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which scientists say is natural in origin, but the country has to battle another vicious "virus" manipulated by U.S. politicians.When it only takes a straightforward comparison of the death tolls to understand the scale of the U.S. administration's failure, the Washington politicians beefed up their "China cover-up" theory.China has taken the most comprehensive, strictest, and most thorough prevention and control measures to battle the epidemic. The government has always stressed that epidemic information must be reported in time and released in an open, transparent, and truthful manner.
