Title : German health minister: Coronavirus reproduction rate at 0.74
Ariticle : 
BERLIN (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany is currently estimated at 0.74 on average, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Monday. 
Authorities are watching this rate closely to see whether to loosen coronavirus restrictions further. Public health experts say that a rate of 1 or above would make it harder to loosen restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus.
