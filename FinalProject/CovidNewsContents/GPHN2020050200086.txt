Fewer Than 50 Active COVID Cases In Manitoba

Public health officials in Manitoba have confirmed two new cases of COVID-19 in the province. As of Thursday, at 9:30 a.m., the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba is 275.
Within Southern Health, there are now 30 total cases. Of those, 25 are confirmed positive, while the other five are probable positive cases.
The data also shows:
• five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care
• 49 active cases and 220 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19
• the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six
As of yesterday, an additional 424 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,723.
Public Health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect May 1. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.
In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. Of the 127 licensed PCHs in Manitoba, 121 have confirmed readiness, with work ongoing to address staffing issues at the remaining sites by the weekend.
It is important to note that while some gradual lifting or restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only. Visits to cottages are not recommended at this time. Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.
A new drive-thru community testing site will open Friday in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation will be daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.
