Title : NATO’s Stoltenberg blasts Chinese, Russian coronavirus disinformation campaign
Ariticle : 
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Monday has accused China and Russia of spreading disinformation regarding the alliance’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Some of the common themes were that the virus is a biological weapon created in the United States, and that China, Iran, and Russia are doing much better than the West in tackling the outbreak.
“We have several examples of statements coming from Moscow and Beijing, which are not correct, which try to undermine the cohesion of NATO allies, and also portrays NATO in the absolutely wrong way”, Stoltenberg said.
He added that both countries “try to portray NATO allies as if we are unable to, for instance, protect our elderly people or that we are not able to work together”.
“We are working together. That’s exactly what we do”, he said.
Last week, EU monitors identified a “trilateral convergence of disinformation narratives” on the coronavirus pandemic, promoted by China, Iran, and Russia.
