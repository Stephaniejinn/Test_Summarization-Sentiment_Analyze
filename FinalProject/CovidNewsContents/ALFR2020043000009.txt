Title : Botswana: Five COVID-19 Patients Recovered
Ariticle : 
Gaborone â€” Five COVID-19 patients have recovered and have since been discharged from Sir Ketumile Masire Medical Teaching Hospital.
The Director of Health Services, Dr Malaki Tshipayagae revealed in an interview with BOPA on April 29 that the five patients were a mixture of men and women, but did not disclose age and even the areas they came from stating that it was unethical to do so.
Dr Tshipayagae said it was normal for patients to recover from COVID-19 even though these were the first batch of recoveries in Botswana since the country recorded its first case mid March.
On whether the relatives of the recovered patients had received counselling, Dr Tshipayagae said counselling and monitoring of recovered patients could only be done when the need arose, stressing that they had been fully equipped on how best they should handle themselves.
Dr Tshipayagae appealed to Batswana to continue practicing extreme social distancing to avert Coronavirus infection.
