Ariticle : 
May 5, 2020 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada
The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, today issued the following statement:
“As Canada and countries around the world gradually take steps to restart our economies, we must support our citizens while protecting their health and safety.
“That’s why we are working closely with our international partners to ensure that the measures we take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic do not impose unjustified or harmful burdens on workers, businesses, and our global economies.
“Today, Canada and the other 20 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] endorsed a 
statement
 committing to mitigate the economic impacts caused by COVID-19 and to plan for economic recovery—especially in developing countries. As a founding member of APEC, Canada recognizes the importance of collaboration with the dynamic and fast-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
“We agreed that it is imperative that trade remains open and predictable to facilitate the flow of essential goods and services, and to minimize disruptions to global supply chains. We agreed that emergency measures designed to tackle COVID-19 must be targeted, proportionate, transparent, temporary, and consistent with World Trade Organization rules.
“Canada’s continued work with our international partners will build on our collective knowledge, experience, and resourcefulness to address this pandemic in a dynamic, innovative, and timely manner.”
