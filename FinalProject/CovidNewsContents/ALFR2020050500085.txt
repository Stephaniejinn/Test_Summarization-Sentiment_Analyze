Title : Kenya: Govt Healthcare Workers Given 10 Million Voice Call Minutes, 195 Terabytes and 33 Million SMSs By Safaricom
Ariticle : 
Nairobi â€” Safaricom will provide 10 million voice call minutes, 195 terabytes of data, and 33 million SMSs to critical government healthcare workers for the next three months.
In a statement, the giant telco says the move follows a request by Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe for communication support for the pandemic response teams who are working tirelessly to combat the coronavirus.
The initiative will see Safaricom avail connectivity resources and airtime to the Ministry of Health, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund, and frontline healthcare workers both at National and County levels.
Under the initiative, government healthcare workers will get a monthly bundle consisting of 12GB data + 600 voice call minutes + 2,000 SMSs per month. These will also get topped up to the individual lines of the COVID-19 frontline workers as identified by the Ministry of Health.
100 Mbps Internet Connectivity will also be given to Afya House for the National Command and Control Centre.
A one-off bundle consisting of 50GB data + 3,500 voice call minutes + 10,000 SMSs will also be sent to 15 members of the COVID-19 Emergency response fund to assist in the smooth running of the fund's activities.
Hon. Mutahi Kagwe, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Health, said:
"As we face this crisis, seamless worry-free communication between the frontline teams, the Command Centre, and their loved ones is crucial. The contribution by Safaricom to support over 5,500 Government healthcare workers will go a long way in helping us execute a coordinated national response," Kagwe said.
"The gallant frontline healthcare workers are our first line of defense against the pandemic and their dedication to serving the country has helped slow down infections within our communities. We not only want to appreciate the great work they are doing, but also facilitate their communication as they continue discharging their duties," Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said.
This commitment adds to the company's ongoing initiatives, currently valued at Sh6.5 billion, to support customers and the country from the negative impact of the pandemic through interventions in financial services, transport, education, and healthcare.
"We are cognizant of the challenge ahead of us and our purpose as an organisation is clear, to keep our customers connected and support Kenyans in whatever way we can," added Ndegwa.
