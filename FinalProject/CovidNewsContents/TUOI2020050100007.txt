As noted by the reporter, although it is a 1-5 public holiday, many weekend entertainment places of Hanoi people such as West Lake and Hoan Kiem Lake are not as crowded as usual.
West Lake is home to many shops but only some shops are open to customers, the rest are closed. Only the restaurants with beautiful d√©cor still attract a lot of families and friends to meet later
days of social spacing.
Although they still wear masks when going to public places, but when they go to eat and drink with friends on holidays, many people tend to leave masks to sit and talk more freely.
The restaurants are not always guaranteed to keep a distance of 2m between customers, or have a shield between the seating positions according to the instruction of April 7, 28 of the Hanoi People&#39;s Committee.
