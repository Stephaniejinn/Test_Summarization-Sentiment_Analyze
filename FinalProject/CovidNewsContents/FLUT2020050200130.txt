Abstract

There has been the need to make major modifications to the way cardiology is practised in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has also been the need to recognise the complex cardiovascular manifestations and complications of COVID-19. In this article we provide guidance on the management of cardiac patients without COVID-19 in the current pandemic as well as patients with cardiac disease and COVID-19 and patients with cardiac complications of COVID-19. There is also a focus on indications and interpretation of commonly performed cardiac investigations in the setting of COVID-19. References are included from a number of specialist societies and groups.
