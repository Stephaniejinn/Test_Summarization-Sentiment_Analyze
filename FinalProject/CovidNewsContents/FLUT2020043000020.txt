HARARE – A patient who was hospitalised suffering from malaria, before testing positive for coronavirus, has been allowed to return home.

The 52-year-old man from Murehwa, 90km north east of Harare in Mashonaland East, “responded well to the treatment for malaria” and “will continue with his (coronavirus) recovery under self-isolation at home,” the ministry of health said on Wednesday.

The man, who became the 32nd person to contract the respiratory illness in Zimbabwe, has no history of travel, the ministry said, adding that they had begun a process of tracing people who came into contact with him.

The patient was being treated at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals since April 24 where his initial diagnosis was malaria.

“He was tested for Covid-19 in line with intensified surveillance and active case finding strategy that is being implemented nationally. Under this approach, all patients admitted in hospital are being tested for Covid-19,” the health ministry said...
