“It will support local health care services – taking the pressure off hospitals and general practices,” she said.
Dr Ross, from Wylie of Ballina Family Medical Centre, is one of the GPs who will operate the clinic.
“It will get COVID-19 swab results back to people via their usual GP really efficiently,” he said. Dr Tonya Coren, principal GP of Cape Byron Medical Centre, said collaboration between health care professionals and organisations such as Cherry Street Sports and NCPHN is an effective way to achieve positive outcomes for the community.
