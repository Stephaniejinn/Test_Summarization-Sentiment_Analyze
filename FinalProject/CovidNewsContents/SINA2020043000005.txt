Original title: Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet: &quot;Britain made the most serious scientific decision-making mistake of a generation&quot;
Recently, in an exclusive interview with the British Financial Times, Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the internationally renowned medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, why western countries did not defend their new crowns as quickly as Asian countries and regions such as China Virus, gave his opinion.
In the interview, Houghton first expressed dissatisfaction with the failure of the United Kingdom and other Western countries to pay enough attention to the warning from China, saying that the Chinese side published a paper in the &quot;Lancet&quot; as early as January 24, which detailed the new crown The virus is terrible and dangerous, but the team of British government experts and relevant officials do not seem to have read this paper and acted in time.
He therefore believes that these British officials and expert teams have committed &quot;the most serious scientific decision-making mistakes of a generation&quot;. This is also what he has always thought of the UK&#39;s epidemic prevention work.
Secondly, in the interview, he gave his views on why Western countries are worse than Asian countries and regions in responding to the new coronavirus epidemic.
He believes that this may be because Asian countries and regions such as China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China treat the new coronavirus as SARS, because the impact of SARS on related countries and regions in Asia was too profound, but Western countries regarded it as The influenza perspective looks at the new coronavirus. He believes that this cognitive bias has caused the West to pay a painful price in the face of the new crown epidemic.
In addition, Horton also reminded countries not to let themselves be complacent after the epidemic was brought under control, especially not to treat the epidemic as a pandemic that swept Europe and the United States in 1918, and mistakenly thought that the epidemic occurred only once in a century.
Because the environment that can breed New Coronavirus, a &quot;zoozoic virus&quot; (that is, a virus that can be transmitted from animals to humans), still exists, 5-6 such viruses have appeared in the past 20 to 30 years, so although The new corona virus seems to be the most violent at present, but there is no guarantee that there will be more terrible in the future.
