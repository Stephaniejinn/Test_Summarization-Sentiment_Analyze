Take Precautions when Forming an Extended Household Group
With extreme caution and under the following conditions, one or two close families may form an extended household group:
Your families or friends must remain consistent. Do not visit different families or friends.
If you are going to create an extended household group, consider if any member of the group has chronic health conditions that would put them at greater risk, or if they are in close contact with someone who could be vulnerable.
Gatherings – inside or outside – must follow the public health order and be no more than 10 people.
Stay home if you are sick.
Maintain physical distancing by keeping two-metres apart.
You should always be aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks. These are the people who would need to be contacted by public health if you were to test positive for COVID-19.
If you are experiencing fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.
