"I have signed a government decree to extend this period until the fight against infection is complete and the epidemiological situation improves," Mishustin said.
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia has extended a ban on entry of foreigners to its territory, which was due to expire Thursday, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Wednesday.
"It is not yet possible to state the exact date when restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus can be completely removed, including for the crossing of the border of the Russian Federation," Mishustin said at a meeting of the  presidium of the government's anti-coronavirus coordination council.
"I have signed a government decree to extend this period until the fight against infection is complete and the epidemiological situation improves," he said.
Mishustin said that for some categories of citizens of foreign countries, entry restrictions will be lifted, including for specialists who carry out adjustment and maintenance of imported equipment.
Such a measure will reduce the negative impact of restrictions on the activities of Russian industrial enterprises including those that manufacture equipment to fight coronavirus infection, he said.
Earlier this month, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said it was considering inviting students, unemployed persons and even convicts to help with field work to compensate a shortage of foreign seasonal workers.
