There are 7,660 positive cases of COVID-19 in Wisconsin as of Saturday, according to the state Department of Health Services. That's an increase of 346 cases from the day before.
This follows a growth in the number of confirmed cases in the state. Friday saw 460 new cases from the day before — the largest single-day increase in positive cases that Wisconsin has seen since the outbreak began in March.
The state has increased its testing capacity.
On Saturday, DHS reported 75,570 negative cases, an increase of 3,004 from Friday to Saturday.
According to figures from DHS, 334 people in Wisconsin have died from COVID-19 as of Saturday afternoon.
DHS reports 1,591 people have been hospitalized because of the virus. That means at least 21 percent of people who have tested positive for the new coronavirus in the state have been hospitalized. DHS officials have said they don't know the hospitalization history of 1,631 cases, or 21 percent.
Douglas County had nine confirmed cases as of Saturday's DHS report, with 530 people who tested negative for the illness. There hasn't been an increase in the number of cases in Douglas County since Wednesday, April 22. Bayfield County had three confirmed cases, with 196 people who tested negative.

A key metric outlined in Gov. Tony Evers' "Badger Bounce Back" plan is for the percentage of positive cases to be in decline over a 14-day period. According to state data, 12.7 percent of tests were positive on Friday and 10.3 percent were positive on Saturday.
Health officials are expanding testing
With the recent increases in testing capacity, health officials have loosened restrictions on who can get tested, subject to the availability of testing supplies.
As of Saturday afternoon, Wisconsin has 51 labs performing COVID-19 tests, up from eight labs in March. According to DHS, they're able to process 11,347 samples per day. The state has a goal of completing about 12,000 tests per day, DHS Secretary Andrea Palm said Monday.
According to a press release, the State Emergency Operations Center, DHS, Wisconsin Emergency Management and Wisconsin National Guard are working with local health departments to hold community testing events in places with a known lack of access to testing or where additional testing is needed. The Wisconsin National Guard tested almost 200 people at a drive-thru testing site at the Buffalo County Highway stop in Alma. More testing sites will be announced in the coming days.
There are confirmed cases in 67 of Wisconsin's 72 counties.
