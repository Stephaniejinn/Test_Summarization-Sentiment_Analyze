As April came to an end Thursday, Muskegon County had seen more than 250 new cases of the novel coronavirus reported over the 30-day month as county health officials ramped up testing.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Muskegon County stood at 276 through the end of April after health officials reported 14 new cases Thursday, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
Health officials also reported another death Thursday, bringing the death toll to 17 at that point.
Muskegon County entered the month of April with 18 confirmed cases of the contagious respiratory disease and two deaths. Since April 1, the number of cases nearly doubled every week during the month.
On April 8, there were 53 cases of COVID-19 and four deaths. On April 15, there were 93 cases and five deaths. And on April 22, there were 173 cases and 11 deaths.
The largest single-day increase yet in Muskegon County was reported Wednesday, when cases shot up by 20 to reach 262, with 16 reported deaths.
Muskegon County health officials have said it will still be several more weeks until the county hits its peak number of cases.
A total of 1,884 coronavirus tests had been conducted in the county, which has a population of more than 173,000. About 14% of those tests have come back positive, according to data provided by the county health department.
Michigan ranks seventh in the country for most cases, but still has the third most deaths, behind New York and New Jersey.
In Muskegon County, women make up about 61% of all coronavirus cases.
However, more men have died with COVID-19 countywide, making up about 59% of all deaths.
Black residents make up about 38% of positive cases countywide, while white residents make up only 26%. However, the breakdown of patients who die with COVID-19 is equal among both races, at about 41% each.

But senior citizens make up the majority of deaths in the county, with about half of the reported deaths being residents over the age of 80.
