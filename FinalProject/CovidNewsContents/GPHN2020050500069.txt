Title : Brazil fears rising agriculture protectionism amid pandemic -draft report
Ariticle : 
BRASILIA, May 4 (Reuters) - Brazilian officials expect the new coronavirus outbreak to spark a rise in global agricultural protectionism, as countries seek to secure local food supplies, according to a draft of an Agriculture Ministry report seen by Reuters.
The report flags the possibility of countries instituting export restrictions, subsidies and other policies that will seek to favor domestic agriculture industries. The conclusions are based on consultations between the ministry and 23 agricultural attach√©s stationed in Brazilian diplomatic outposts around the world.
