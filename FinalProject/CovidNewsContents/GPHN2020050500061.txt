LONG SAULT — Answers are still coming in after a COVID-19 outbreak was reported at the Woodland Villa long-term care facility on Friday.
South Stormont Mayor Bryan McGillis said he spoke to Janna Sabourin, administrator of Woodland Villa, briefly, on Sunday afternoon.
“It was just business as usual prior to this happening, as far as I know,” said McGillis. “That’s the thing; it’s such a surprise to everyone. I didn’t know anything about it until (Saturday). My daughter asked me and I said what!?”

An email from Sabourin to families of the residents notes that of the tests conducted at the facility on Milles Roches Road, two have return positive. There were 238 tests conducted in the home.
“I talked to Woodland earlier and they seem to have everything under control,” said McGillis.
This is the third COVID-19 outbreak within the EOHU region, the first one at Pinecrest Nursing home in Plantagenet was declared on April 22. It is still ongoing. The second outbreak was reported At Milieux de vie a L’Érablière (Valoris group home) in Planatagenet. That was declared April 7 and closed on April 23.
McGillis is concerned about the other seniors’ home in Long Sault, Sunset Cove Retirement Residence. He was not able to provide more information, at the time, but said he will have an update on Monday. As a retirement home, the medical needs of residents at Sunset are lower, as is the level of support provided.
Woodland Villia, owned by Omini Health Care, has 111 prviate, semi-private and basic beds. McGillis did talk to Sabourin last week about getting more personal protective equipment for all those who require it.
