Title : Third B.C. poultry processing plant reports confirmed case of COVID-19
Ariticle : 
CHILLIWACK, B.C. â€” A third poultry processor in British Columbia is reporting a worker has tested positive for COVID-19.
Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry in Chilliwack says in a social media post that an employee tested positive Tuesday but had been in isolation at home since last Friday after developing mild systems.
The company says it is working with health officials and government inspectors to ensure all recommended protocols, precautions and procedures are implemented.
Two other poultry operations in Metro Vancouver were ordered closed by health officials this month when workers at the plants tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
As of Tuesday, 80 COVID-19 cases had been linked to the two poultry facilities, with 46 at Superior Poultry Processors Ltd. in Coquitlam and 34 at United Poultry Co. Ltd. in Vancouver.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has said there is no indication food is a source of transmission of the virus.
Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, which produces organic and specialty chicken, duck, squab and free-run geese, says similar businesses have not been required to recall products after COVID-19 outbreaks.
The statement says its office and farm store remains open.
"However, our plant will be closed Wednesday, April 29 as we meet with officials to plan our next steps."
The province has reported 2,053 cases of the new coronavirus, with 1,231 cases successfully recovered, but B.C. had also recorded 105 deaths.
