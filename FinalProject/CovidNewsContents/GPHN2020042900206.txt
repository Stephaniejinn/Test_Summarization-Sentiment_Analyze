Title : Bolsonaro says he can't 'perform miracles' to fix virus crisis
Ariticle : 
Rio de Janeiro (dpa) - Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro drew attention again on Tuesday with comments that he cannot perform wonders during the coronavirus crisis, despite having a second name synonymous with a leading saviour.
Asked by journalists about an increase in new virus cases, the president said "And? I'm so sorry. What should I do? I am Messias, but I do not perform miracles."
Bolsonaro's second name is Messias - meaning messiah.
The president played down the virus before. He considered lockdown measures in place around the country to be excessive and wants life to return to normal as quickly as possible.
His newly appointed health minister, Nelson Teich, on Wednesday proposed easing restrictions on movement.
In the dispute over the correct handling of the virus, the right-wing populist health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had advocated a strict line, was dismissed.
Brazil was the first country on the South American continent to register a confirmed case of the coronavirus.
The country has registered 474 deaths in 24 hours from Covid-19, bringing the overall deaths to 5,017.
This means Brazil has overtaken the death toll in China, where there were 4,643 officially registered deaths.
Hospitals and cemeteries in several cities have already reached their limits in dealing with Covid-19 patients.
