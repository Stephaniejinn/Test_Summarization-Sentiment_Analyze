NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Practice social distancing on wheels! Partha Saha, a self-made automobile engineer, modified a bike to maintain social distance as a preventative measure against the spread of COVID-19. The long central chassis of the bike increased the gap between the two seats by more than 1.5 meters. He planned to take his daughter to school after the lockdown.
