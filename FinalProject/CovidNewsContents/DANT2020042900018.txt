Ariticle : 

From 6 am on 16/4 to 18/4 on 29/4, Vietnam has spent more than 13 days without any cases of infection in the community.

Out of 270 cases of Covid-19, up to 130 cases of entry were quarantined upon returning to Vietnam.

Up to now, the total number of people in close contact and entry from the epidemic area are being monitored for health (isolation): 42,057, of which:

- Centralized isolation at the hospital: 323.

- Isolation concentrated in other establishments: 6,643.

- Isolating at home and place of residence: 35,091.

Regarding the situation of treatment, up to now 219/270 patients have been cured, discharged.

In particular, especially the last time recorded cases of re-positive after treatment.

According to the report of the National Steering Committee for the Prevention and Combat of Covid-19, the latest detection of 2 more positive patients returned to SARS-CoV-2.

The case of re-positive 130 is very complicated. Male 30-year-old patient was taken to the Central Tropical Diseases Hospital on March 23, after 7 days of treatment, the patient was declared cured on March 30, then continued to be monitored at the Hospital. Central Tropical Diseases 2.

On 4/4, the patient tested positive for 6 consecutive negative results. On April 19, the patient continued to have positive test results after 7 consecutive negative tests. Tests on April 25-26 continued to yield positive results.

The second case of re-positive patients was patient No. 50. This 50-year-old man was treated at the Central Tropical Diseases Hospital No. 2 from March 13. This is a very serious case that requires mechanical ventilation through intubation, but was cured by the hospital, announced to be discharged on April 14, but continued to follow up for another 14 days at the hospital as prescribed.

However, by April 21, patients had positive results after 5 consecutive negative tests; test results on April 24 and April 27 were still positive.

Currently, both patients are still being monitored at the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases 2.

Currently, of the 51 cases being treated, 14 cases have had a test result of 1 -2 times negative for SARS-CoV-2.

In South Korea, more than 100 cases of re-positive for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported after being recovered. In theory, some positive cases can have live viruses and cause patients to show symptoms, potentially spreading to others. However, secondary infections have not been recorded from these cases.

In Vietnam, in order to study the positive cases, the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology conducted viral culture on 3 patients who were re-positive. After 1 week of virus culture, initial results showed that the virus did not develop.

According to Assoc.Prof. Dr. Le Quynh Mai, Deputy Director of the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, when the virus was grown but the virus did not develop due to the weak virus, unable to multiply, not enough concentration to infect cells, amplify onto the cell.

“Viruses do not live, so they cannot spread them to others. Viruses that are contagious must be healthy and have a certain concentration. In principle, the virus is always cultivated 3 times in a row, ”said Dr. Mai.

However, to ensure safety, avoid the risk of transmission, re-positive patients were hospitalized again, isolated, monitored at medical facilities.
