THUNDER BAY - The Thunder Bay district has three new confirmed cases of COVID-19, including one individual in her 70s who is hospitalized and another who is a member of a First Nations community. The Thunder Bay District Health Unit made the announcement late Saturday afternoon.

The two other new cases include a man in his 30s identified as being part of a First Nations community, and a woman in her 40s in Thunder Bay or the surrounding area. Both are now self-isolating at home.
The new cases bring the district's total number of confirmed cases to 74. Only 18 of those are active, while 55 are considered resolved, and one man died of the disease .
The health unit had conducted a total of 3,911 tests as of Friday. 3,840 had returned negative, including 1,034 from local long-term care homes.
