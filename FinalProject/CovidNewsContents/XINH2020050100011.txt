BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities Thursday urged people in the country to remain vigilant about COVID-19 while traveling during the upcoming five-day May Day holiday.
Tourists are urged to make reservations before visiting tourist sites, honestly report their health information, have their body temperatures checked and keep a distance from others, Luo Shugang, minister of culture and tourism, said at a press conference in Beijing.
They should also wear face masks, wash hands, dine separately and keep healthy lifestyles, said medical experts at the press conference.
Tourist sites are required to remind visitors of epidemic prevention and civilized travel via bulletin boards, electronic screens or radios, said Luo, adding that tourist sites will also step up the offering of volunteer services.
Wang Chen, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, advised elderly and children to stay even more vigilant and avoid traveling at the moment if possible.
This year's May Day holiday will run from May 1 to 5.
