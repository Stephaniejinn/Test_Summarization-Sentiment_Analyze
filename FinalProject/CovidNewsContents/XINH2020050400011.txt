ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The new deaths from COVID-19 in Italy over the past 24 hours fell to 174 on Sunday, the lowest level since the start of the national lockdown on March 10.
Italy's Ministry of Health said Sunday that the daily new deaths pushed the country's death toll to 28,884.
The lowest daily deaths in nearly two months comes on the eve of the easing of the eight-week lockdown on Monday. The last time the figure so low was registered on March 10, the first day of the lockdown, when 168 people died from the disease.
