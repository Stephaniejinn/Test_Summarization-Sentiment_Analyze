WELLINGTON -- New Zealand and Australia were committed to introducing a trans-Tasman COVID-safe travel zone as soon as it was safe to do so, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her Australian counterpart Scott Morrison said on Tuesday.
The prime ministers agreed to commence work on a trans-Tasman COVID-safe travel zone - easing travel restrictions between Australia and New Zealand. Such an arrangement would be put in place once it was safe to do so and necessary health, transport and other protocols had been developed and met to ensure the protection of public health, said a statement released by the New Zealand government.
This arrangement recognized that Australia and New Zealand were both successfully addressing the spread of COVID-19. Any arrangement would need to take into account state and territory movement restrictions, it said.
New Zealand reported no new COVID-19 case over the past 24 hours for two consecutive days, which was "very encouraging", Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said on Tuesday.
New Zealand announced Tuesday that the State of National Emergency to support the COVID-19 response will be extended for a sixth time, for a further seven days.
