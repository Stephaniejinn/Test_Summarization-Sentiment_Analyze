Tarrant County officials confirmed 115 new COVID-19 cases and two more deaths Saturday while warning community spread of the virus continues to be substantial, even as some restrictions are being lifted.
There have been a total 2,503 coronavirus cases and 71 deaths, according to the county public health department.
The two residents whose deaths were reported included a man in his 60s from Fort Worth and a man in his 50s from Keller, officials said in a news release. Both had underlying health conditions.
"Our condolences go out to the families," Tarrant County Health Director Vinny Taneja said in the release.
Taneja also encouraged residents to heed guidelines about staying home as much as possible and social distancing as stay-at-home requirements are expiring.
The 115 cases announced Saturday follow 142 new cases Friday, which represented the second-highest single-day high, and 97 cases Thursday.
The county also announced seven more deaths Thursday, a single-day high. All of the individuals who died were Fort Worth residents.
Male Tarrant County residents have made up about 52 percent coronavirus cases and 62 percent of deaths, data from the health department show.
Also, around 65 percent of deaths have involved people over the age of 65, even though that age group only makes up about 19 percent of cases.
