The International Committee of the Red Cross says governments in the Asia Pacific must "systematically include" migrants, regardless of their legal status in their coronavirus response programmes, and take "all possible measures" to reduce the use of immigration detention.
"Governments in the region should do more for the migrants," said Christine Cipolla, ICRC regional director for Asia and the Pacific. "It is in their best interest. It saves lives. It protects society as a whole."
Migrants, including refugees, make up a large proportion of the population in several countries and play a crucial role in the economy, the ICRC statement noted.
US President Donald Trump says the US is considering testing passengers on international flights for the coronavirus.
"We're looking at doing it on international flights coming out of areas that are heavily infected," Trump said at the White House." He added that the administration was already discussing the plan with airlines and it could be introduced "in the very near future".
The US has a third of all confirmed coronavirus cases in the world and the most deaths anywhere.
