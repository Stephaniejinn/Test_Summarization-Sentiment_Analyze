Title : County's coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths flatten
Ariticle : 
Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus remained relatively flat in Yolo County over the past week, with only the city of West Sacramento seeing a double digit increase in the number of confirmed cases and no new deaths being reported countywide in almost a week. Hospitalizations have also remained flat.
More than 2,240 residents have been tested for the virus so far but that number will begin to ramp up beginning Tuesday when a community testing center capable of testing 135 people per day opens in Woodland.
As of Saturday, the county had 171 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths.
The city of Woodland still has the most confirmed cases in the county — 83 — but only four new cases have been reported since April 23. Most of those Woodland cases are from a single location, the Stollwood Convalescent Hospital at St. John's Retirement Village, which had 66 cases as of Saturday and no new cases reported in almost a week. Eleven Stollwood residents have died.
The city of West Sacramento did see a jump in confirmed cases in recent days, a total of 11 since April 23, while Davis has reported only two new cases in the last week. The combined Winters/unincorporated areas of the county have 11 confirmed cases and none since April 20.
County officials say the shelter-in-place order in effect for six weeks now has successfully flattened the curve and slowed the spread of the virus, evident in the current numbers, including the low rate of hospitalizations.
Since the pandemic began, 32 county residents have required hospitalization at some point, and most of those individuals — 25 — were over the age of 55.
However, the 25-34 age group actually has the most confirmed cases in the county (28), followed by the 55-64 age group with 26.
Deaths are highest among those over age 85 — seven of the 16 total. All of the Yolo County residents who have died of the novel coronavirus were over the age of 55.
Meanwhile, a total of three county residents under the age of 18 have tested positive for the virus but none have been hospitalized. Nine young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 have tested positive and one required hospitalization.
