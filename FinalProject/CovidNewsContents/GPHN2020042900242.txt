Title : China to hold delayed annual parliament meeting on May 22
Ariticle : 
China will hold a postponed annual session of its parliament from May 22, state-run media said Wednesday, signaling the government's confidence that it has brought the country's coronavirus outbreak under control.
Every year, the National People's Congress takes place for around 10 days from March 5 at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, with about 3,000 delegates gathering from across the nation to discuss and endorse key policies for the coming year.
But the government in February made an unprecedented decision to postpone the meeting for an unspecified period as it struggled to contain the pneumonia-causing virus which had spread across the country.
There was apparently concern within the ruling Communist Party and the government that a gathering of officials in Beijing from all across China would increase the risk of the epidemic worsening.
China's nationwide virus numbers, however, have dwindled in recent weeks, with the months-long lockdown on the hardest-hit central city of Wuhan lifted on April 8.
Since the new coronavirus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year, China has reported more than 80,000 infection cases for the mainland, with over 4,500 deaths linked to COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.
The congress had convened March 5 every year since 1998. Even in 2003, when a virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, raged in China, the annual session went ahead as usual.
Following the postponement of the parliamentary session, Chinese President Xi Jinping delayed his state visit to Japan planned for early April with both governments agreeing that his visit "must be ensured in the most opportune time, environment and atmosphere."
