Title : South Africa begins to mitigate pandemic restrictions
Ariticle : 
JOHANESBURG (AP) â€” South Africa began On Friday to mitigate one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Runners and walkers returned to the streets, although not all with protective masks that are now mandatory in the country with more cases of coronavirus in Africa.
In Johannesburg, Cape Town and other cities people went out to breathe fresh air and some headed to shopping malls to buy clothes for the winter, which brings a new challenge: flu season.
South Africa has more than 5,600 cases of coronavirus. Concern among health workers remains high. On Friday, health workers, unions and members of civil society protested outside one of the country's best-known hospitals, Chris Hani Baragwanath, in Soweto, in demand for personal protective equipment.
With restriction mitigation, many businesses can resume limited operations. Many mines, factories and agricultural businesses can resume their jobs in phases, starting with only a third of their employees. Restaurants can be reopened only for home deliveries.
People can now leave their homes to work out between 6 and 9 a.m. A night curfew is in effect from 8pm until 5 a.m. Public transport, including buses, can operate with limited numbers of passengers. But the ban on domestic and international passenger flights continues.
According to the authorities, schools should reopen in stages from 1 June with pupils in grades 7 and 12, the highest in primary and secondary, respectively. But teachers' guilds have protested, saying schools should not be reopened until safe conditions can be guaranteed.
There has been no date for the reopening of universities, a sector that is increasingly targeting online classes.
