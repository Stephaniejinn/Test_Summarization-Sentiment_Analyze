Original title: The American media did not cooperate, and Trump fired again: These two crazy attempts to protect China!
(Text / Observer Net Long Yue) Just after the new charge of &quot;China Puppet&quot; was put on CNN and NBC, US President Trump fired again!
On the 5th, Trump did not give any reason, and he violently attacked two US media on Twitter: &quot;MSDNC and fake news CNN are frantically trying to protect China!&quot;
&quot;MSDNC&quot; refers to the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) news channel &quot;MSNBC&quot;, which Trump deliberately rewritten, implying that the media is controlled by Democrats.
The US news website &quot;Story Line&quot; analyzed that Trump did not disclose how these media protect China, but both news reports mentioned that the Trump administration has no evidence that the new crown virus originated from the Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. stand by.
CNN issued a document on the 5th that shared intelligence between the &quot;Five Eyes Alliance&quot; showed that the new crown virus did not come from a Chinese laboratory. This is contrary to the statements made by Trump and US Secretary of State Pompeo. A well-informed Western diplomat believes that &quot;this is likely to occur naturally, and human infections may come from the interaction of natural people and animals.&quot;
On the 4th, the American &quot;anti-epidemic captain&quot; Anthony Fudge also &quot;slaps his face&quot; Pompeo said there is no scientific evidence that the virus came from a Chinese laboratory.
MSNBC news anchor Chris Hayes talked on the show why the theory that the new coronavirus came from the laboratory was untenable. He said, &quot;The Trump administration desperately wants to save lives, trying to find someone to take responsibility, so that they don&#39;t even understand what they are talking about. They just want a convenient scapegoat.
Netizens mocked and said, &quot;Since Trump described the New Crown Virus as a hoax and a flu, he praised China 15 times.&quot; Why should he blame others? Some netizens said bluntly, &quot;The truth will eventually come to light. This is not China ’s fault, but Trump ’s fault. Trump ignored or even denied the existence of new coronary pneumonia ... The United States has become the world ’s most severe country, and the responsibility lies with Trang General. &quot;According to CNN statistics on April 22, Trump has praised China at least 37 times since January.
As we all know, US media such as CNN have repeatedly distorted the facts, discredited China, and incited biased public opinion. However, since the outbreak of the New Crown epidemic in the United States, CNN, NBC and other media have continuously warned the American public and criticized the government for its ineffective response. Therefore, CNN, NBC, etc. were stabbed in Trump&#39;s eyes and stabbed in the flesh.
At the beginning of the spread of the epidemic in the United States, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and CNN accused the White House of publicly downplaying the epidemic and criticized Trump for delivering &quot;seriously misleading&quot; messages. However, at the time, Trump, who tried to convey optimism, criticized the media for exaggerating the facts and sensationalizing.
On February 26, Trump tweeted that “the situation in the United States is good”, and the low-profile fake news “MSDNC” and CNN are doing everything they can to make the new crown virus look as bad as possible, including manufacturing market panic .
In the recent period, the situation of the new crown epidemic in the United States has become more severe. The current number of diagnoses has broken 1.17 million, and the number of deaths has reached 68,000. The downward pressure on the US economy is also increasing, and the number of unemployed people is hitting new highs. Trump and a group of U.S. official politicians began to play the “dump pot” game, discrediting China ’s opaque data and untimely sharing of information, etc., to shirk responsibility for the epidemic and shift internal conflicts.
At this time, when CNN and NBC did not cooperate with the Trump administration&#39;s &quot;dumping pot&quot;, Trump gave them a new charge: &quot;Chinese puppet.&quot;
On May 1, Trump tweeted, &quot;Concast (Trump&#39;s name for NBC parent company Comcast, con is fraudulent) and fake news CNN, they spare no effort to say good things about China. They want to do it there Chinese puppets in business. They use American media to help China. The enemy of the people! &quot;
US media analysis said that Trump slammed China for his political purpose of winning re-election. NBC said in an April 29 article, &quot;It turns out that blaming China&#39;s economic difficulties on China is effective for Trump&#39;s political foundation.&quot; The US &quot;Politico&quot; also pointed out that Republicans and the Trump campaign team Want to make criticism of China as the central theme of Trump&#39;s re-election.
