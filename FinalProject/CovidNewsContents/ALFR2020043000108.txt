The taskforce chair ministry of Disaster Preparedness and Public Events' principal secretary said the K450 000 per day for Cabinet ministers and K350 000 per day for members of parliament has been suspended pending further consultations.
"No one has been paid that amount yet, we have put it on hold until we make further consultations on the matter," he said.
He, however, said that the Cabinet ministers and the members of parliament will be required to move around on covid-19 mission and they would need allowances for food, accommodation and fuel.
"They will need to see how prepared are councils on the epidemic," he said.
