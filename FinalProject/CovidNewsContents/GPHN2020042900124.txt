There were more resolutions than COVID-19 cases reported by Ontario Public Health Units as of Saturday, along with a record number of 12,020 more tests conducted across the province. 
Three of these cases were reported in Northern Ontario, along with eight recoveries by the Porcupine Health Unit. One case was found in the Cochrane, Matheson, Iroquois Falls and Smooth Rock Falls area , one in the Thunder Bay district , and another in the area of Sault Ste. Marie . 
Resolutions as defined by the Ministry of Health, include all cases reported to as recovered by Ontario’s 33 Public Health Units and the Coronavirus Entry System, as well as cases 14 days past symptom onset or date of infection, in the event that the patient was asymptomatic. Meaning that some cases considered resolved could hypothetically still be experiencing symptoms. 
There are now 6,432 active cases in the province of the original 14,432 confirmed to have the virus, following the report of 437 new cases and 491 recoveries. Of these individuals, an additional 13 more have been hospitalized, contributing to a total of 938 to date, 252 are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 195 are in the ICU on a ventilator. 
An additional 24 deaths were reported as part of the latest provincial update, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related fatalities to 835. Reports by long-term care facilities still make up around 54-78 per cent of these fatailites, depending on the variation between reports by the Ministry of Long-Term Care and Public Health Ontario.

The Ministry of Long-Term Care has reported 147 outbreaks to date, leading to 2,520 cases among residents and 1,161 cases among staff. This has resulted in the deaths of 654 residents and less than five employees.

A total of 229,638 tests have been performed in Ontario as of April 26 at 1 p.m., 207,789 being negative. 
Northern Ontario health units have been responsible for 12,207 of these tests, resulting in the diagnosis of 228 individuals, including 177 recoveries and five deaths.
