Italy entered into a national lockdown on March 10 to contain the pandemic. The lockdown, expected to last until May 3, will be followed by a so-called "Phase Two," which involves the gradual resumption of social, economic and productive activities.
Starting on May 4, the manufacturing, construction, and wholesale sectors will reopen, to be followed by retailers, museums, galleries, and libraries on May 18, and bars, restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons on June 1.  All businesses will have to follow rigorous workplace safety protocols.
