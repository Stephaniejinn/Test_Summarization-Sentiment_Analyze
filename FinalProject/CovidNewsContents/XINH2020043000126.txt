KUWAIT CITY, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts on Thursday shared the prevention and control knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic with the Chinese community in Kuwait via a video workshop.
The seminar, organized by the Chinese Embassy in Kuwait, was attended by more than 1,000 overseas Chinese in Kuwait, including Chinese students and employees of the Chinese companies.
The experts gave a detailed introduction to the transmission route of the coronavirus, the dos and don'ts for prevention and control, and treatment through traditional Chinese medicine.
Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Li Minggang said that the Chinese Embassy attaches great importance to the health of overseas Chinese in Kuwait and spares no efforts to provide them with full support.
"The embassy will continue maintaining close communication with the Kuwaiti side and providing efficient and comprehensive information services for overseas Chinese," Li noted.

The Chinese medical experts arrived in Kuwait on Monday night to help the Arab country fight coronavirus.
