Title : Botswana: Quality Meat Donates Meat
Ariticle : 
Gaborone â€” Quality Meat Wholesale, Retail and Processed Meat has donated meat worth over P170 000 to the COVID-19 Relief Fund.
The meat will benefit some residents in Kgatleng, Tlokweng and Kweneng who are affected by the pandemic.
Receiving the donation, Kgatleng District Council secretary, Mr Mpho Mathe said the meat would be given to Batswana in dire need.
He said although the council had helped others with meat, it was not enough and that the donation came at the right time.
Chief executive officer of the meat wholesale, Mr Jaco de Villiers said they found it fit to donate 4 000kg of meat to the relief fund, as that would go help Batswana during the lockdown.
He said despite the fact that his company offered essential services, it had also been affected by the lockdown.
He said many customers could not reach their sale outlets to buy meat.
