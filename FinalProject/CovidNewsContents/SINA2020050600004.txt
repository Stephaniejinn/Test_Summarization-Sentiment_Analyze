According to CCTV News, on the 4th local time, the Iranian Parliament voted to pass an amendment to the Iranian Currency and Banking Law, which changed the official currency &quot;Rial&quot; to &quot;Toman&quot;.
The new bill requires the Central Bank of Iran to recalculate the exchange rate in &quot;Turman&quot; after considering currency reserves and commitments to the International Monetary Fund. The law also clearly stipulates that &quot;rial&quot; will maintain its credibility with &quot;Turman&quot; for two years. During this period, old coins and banknotes will be gradually collected and replaced with new coins and banknotes.
It is understood that the new currency conversion will be 10,000 rials for 1 Turman.
Iran ’s plan to change its sovereign currency has been brewing since 2008. In recent years, after the United States unilaterally restarted its economic sanctions against Iran, the Iranian currency has continued to depreciate, and the situation of introducing Turman is more urgent.
　　
In recent years, under the influence of US sanctions, the Iranian rial exchange rate has continued to fall. In the past 10 years, the Iranian rial has depreciated more than 400% against the dollar.
In particular, since May 2018, when US President Trump announced his withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement and restarted sanctions against Iran in stages, the depreciation of the Iranian rial against the US dollar has become faster and faster.
On May 2, the official exchange rate announced by the Iranian Central Bank was 1 U.S. dollar against 42,000 Iranian rials. However, on the informal trading platform, the exchange rate of the Iranian rial to the US dollar on May 4 was 1 US dollar to 156,000 Iranian rial.
The severe currency depreciation has caused prices in the Iranian market to rise and almost double. In addition to potatoes, eggs, lamb, milk, juice, and other common foods in households have doubled in price. The dried fruits such as pistachios, which are essential for Iranian people ’s holiday families, have soared to 2 million rials (about 100 yuan) )the above.
According to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Iran, the Iranian Economic and Trade News reported on April 27 that the Iranian Statistics Center released the basic food inflation report for January 1399 (2020.3.20-4.19) in the urban area of the Iranian calendar. It was identified as the second month affected by the epidemic. According to the report, 21 of the 24 basic foods have seen prices increase. Among them, tomatoes, potatoes and lentils had the highest increases, up 35.3%, 23.6% and 19.5% sequentially. Only the prices of chicken, tomato paste and butter declined slightly. In addition, because oranges are rich in vitamin C, which is beneficial to fight viruses, prices have increased by 46% in the past three months.
The Iranian &quot;Tehran Times&quot; reported on March 22 that the National Statistics Center (SCI) released data showing that the inflation rate in the previous fiscal year (March 2019 to March 2020) was 34.8%, a decrease of 2.2% from the previous year. . At the same time, the inflation rate in the last month of the last fiscal year (February to March 2020) fell by 3% from the previous month, of which the inflation rate in urban areas fell by 2.9% to 22.2%; the inflation rate in rural areas fell by 3.3% to 21.1% .
Soaring prices continue to dilute the wealth of Iranians.
According to a report by the China Daily in February 2019, the minimum wage for Iranian workers is US $ 92 per month at the exchange rate at that time, while the poverty line in Iran is US $ 500 per month. From 2018 to 2019, the proportion of Iran ’s population below the poverty line increased by 12% to about 50%.
In July 2019, Iran once again raised the minimum wage to about US $ 116. In addition, it also increased housing subsidies, but food subsidies, maternity subsidies, etc., but considering the country&#39;s inflation rate, this increase has a need For the ordinary worker family, there is no point.

Previously, examples of currency changes due to severe inflation have also appeared internationally.
Zimbabwe changed the currency twice in 2006 and 2008 to increase the value of the new currency. However, after changing the currency for a period of time, Zimbabwe ’s currency will depreciate wildly again. In January 2009, 1 US dollar could even be exchanged to 10 31 The second power. After that, Zimbabwe officially announced that it would remove the yuan from the country ’s official currency and switch to a variety of official currency systems such as the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen.
