Title : Botswana: Bomawu Mourns Journalists Lost to COVID-19
Ariticle : 
Gaborone â€” Botswana Media and Allied Workers Union (BOMAWU) president, Phillimon Mmeso has paid tribute to journalists who died in line of duty as a result of COVID-19.
In his message to fellow media workers on Press Freedom Day on May 3, Mmeso says this year's celebrations are interesting and yet challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"I would like to congratulate journalists in Botswana and the world over for devoting to their work despite the challenging environment. Some of our comrades, while in line of duty have been infected with COVID-19 and sadly some departed this earthly home, but amidst all that, our pens have remained mightier."
Mmeso calls upon journalists to remain strong and steadfast as they continue to play a part in helping the nation in a way better than ever before.
"This year has seen positive developments regarding the relationship between the state and media especially in regard to the private media."
He says government has engaged the media on COVID-19 pandemic, 'a development we applaud and hope it will continue post the pandemic.'
As a union, he says they are representing the welfare of media workers and are still concerned about their poor working conditions in the private media, poor wages, long working hours and sexual harassment of female journalists by their line managers resulting in their dismissal from work.
As long as journalists are not well remunerated, he says media freedom will remain a mirage in Botswana.
