Abstract

From the first reports, ageusia and anosmia appear to be frequent clinical features in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients. We have performed a survey of the literature, analyzing the possible causes of these chemosensory alterations, which may be useful as a starting point for specific further studies.
