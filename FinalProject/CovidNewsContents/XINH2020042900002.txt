BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Looking out for each other in trying times is what the BRICS spirit is all about, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Tuesday.
Wang made the remarks when addressing BRICS Foreign Ministers' Extraordinary Conference on COVID-19 via video link. BRICS is an emerging-market bloc that groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
At the toughest moment in China's fight against the disease, fellow BRICS countries and the rest of the international community extended valuable support to China, Wang said. "We will never forget such acts of friendship."
The foreign minister said as the virus hits more countries around the world, China is doing everything it can to help those in need.
"In spite of substantial demand at home and growing pressures to meet foreign orders, China has provided a large amount of medical supplies to fellow BRICS countries, and facilitated the purchase of such supplies through commercial channels," he said.
Going forward, China is ready to step up the sharing of information and experience with BRICS countries and conduct joint research and development of drugs and vaccines on the basis of respecting each other's sovereignty and national conditions, said Wang.
"Given the close personnel exchanges among us, we should provide equal protection to the foreign nationals, including students, in each other's countries," Wang said. "I am confident that,  by working together in solidarity, we will forge an ironclad shield against the virus."
