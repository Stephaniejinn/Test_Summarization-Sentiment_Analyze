Of those actively infected, 1,795 are in intensive care -- down by 68 compared to Tuesday, and 19,210 are hospitalized in normal wards -- down by 513. The rest, or 80 percent of those who tested positive, are in isolation at home.
Italy entered into a national lockdown on March 10 to contain the pandemic. The lockdown, expected to last until May 3, will be followed by a so-called "Phase Two," which involves the gradual resumption of social, economic and productive activities.
Beginning May 4, the manufacturing, construction, and wholesale sectors can resume work. Following them are retailers, museums, galleries, and libraries on May 18, and bars, restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons on June 1. All businesses will have to follow rigorous workplace safety protocols.
