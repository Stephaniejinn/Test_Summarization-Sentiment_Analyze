Title : Coronavirus: Malaysia to ease some restrictions on Monday, says PM Muhyiddin
Ariticle : 
KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysians from Monday (May 4) can return to work, jog at public parks and eat at restaurants while maintaining social distancing, in a relaxation of movement curbs first imposed in March.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Friday (May 1) also announced several steps to reopen the economy after more than six weeks of a partial lockdown that has put a dent in the economy.
"After holding a meeting (with relevant agencies), we are ready to open up the economy," he said in a televised address on May Day on Friday.
"Beginning May 4, almost all economic sectors will be allowed to open with conditions. This is important as business and work is a source of income. If we are under MCO for too long, we will not get any income and this will have a bad impact on your finances," he added, referring to the movement control order (MCO).
Malaysia on Friday is in its 45th day of the movement control order, which was imposed on March 18 in a bid to flatten the coronavirus infection curve. it has been extended a number of times.
Steps to reopen the economy come as Malaysia on Thursday (April 30) reported 16 consecutive days of double-digit new coronavirus cases, a far cry from triple-digit new cases a day in March and early April.
Additionally, Malaysia has also recorded a high patient recovery rate of 69.5 per cent.
Malaysia's Health Director General Noor Hisham Abdullah on Tuesday (April 28) said that Malaysia is now in a "recovery phase" of the outbreak as recovered patients have outnumbered new cases.
The updated, or conditional, MCO, however, bars Malaysians from joining activities involving body contact such as football, rugby, swimming at a public pool, religious mass gatherings and Ramadan food bazaars.
