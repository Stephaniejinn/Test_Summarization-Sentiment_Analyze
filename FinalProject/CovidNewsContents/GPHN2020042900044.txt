Title : Woman born during Spanish Flu survives second pandemic
Ariticle : 
MOHEGAN LAKE, N.Y. — A New York woman who was born during the Spanish Flu pandemic has survived COVID-19.
Angelina Friedman, who lives in a nursing home in Lake Mohegan, was taken to a hospital for a minor medical procedure on March 21. But her procedure was postponed after she tested positive for COVID-19.
After intermittently running a fever for several weeks, the 101-year-old cancer survivor tested negative for the virus on April 20, WPIX-TV reported Monday.
“My mother is a survivor,” said Joanne Merola, Friedman's daughter. “She has super-human DNA.”
Friedman was born on a passenger ship taking immigrants from Italy to New York City in 1918. Her mother died giving birth on the ship.
Friedman has outlived her husband, Harold, and her 10 siblings.
