RIGA -- A group of Latvian IT and telecommunication companies have joined forces to develop a mobile application for tracking contacts of people infected with the novel coronavirus, local media reported Tuesday.
Developers of the app hope that initially it will be used by some 400,000 of Latvia's 1.9 million residents, thus helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the population.
The app, which uses Bluetooth to detect the presence of an infected person and runs on iOS and Android devices, will be available for free downloading in mid-May, the developers said at a news conference.
