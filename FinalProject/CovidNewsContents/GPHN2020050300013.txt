WHO approves human clinical trials for covid-19 vaccines
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 102 potential Covid-19 vaccines still undergoing clinical trials.
According to FOX NEWS , only 8 out of the 102 have been approved for human trials.
As the coronavirus pandemic infects over three million people, scientists from all over the world are tirelessly working to find a cure and/or solution.
Of the groups approved by WHO for clinical trials on humans, four are from China, one is from England, one is American and another is a combined American and European group. No African request has been approved.
WHO reported, on March 16, that the American National Institute of Health (NIH) became the first institute to start testing in human trial subjects.
COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei province, in late 2019.
So far, according to the global tally, there are 3,308,643 coronavirus infections worldwide, 1,042,981 recoveries, and 234,123 deaths.

Even the one from Madagascar which has been in use with tremendous result of efficacy has not been recognised by WHO. Madagascar has 128 confirmed cases, with  98 recovering. It has zero death,  zero new cases. To hell with WHO!!
