Hastings-Prince Edward Public Health has added two more lab-confirmed cases to the running total on their website, bringing the total to 43 between Hastings and Prince Edward Counties.
No deaths or recoveries have happened since the health unit’s last update. Those numbers stay at four and 20 respectively.
3,202 tests have been done by Public Health. With 43 coming back positive, that means 2,846 have been negative. That’s a positivity rate of 1.3-percent. There are also 313 cases pending, which includes 195 probable cases of the virus.
Public Health’s dashboard still says there are between five and nine cases of COVID-19 in North Hastings.
