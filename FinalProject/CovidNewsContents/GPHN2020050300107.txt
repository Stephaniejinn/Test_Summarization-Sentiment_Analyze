Authorities urged the public to adhere to preventative measures such as social distancing and staying at home to slow the spread of the virus.
“With our commitment to health isolation and social distancing, we will prevent ourselves, our families, and our community from the spread of the coronavirus,” the ministry said in a statement.
The first two coronavirus cases in Oman were announced on February 24 after two Omani women were infected during a trip to Iran.
Since then, the government has imposed strict measures to prevent the virus from spreading further. The capital Muscat was put under a complete lockdown, and Ramadan mass gatherings were banned.
