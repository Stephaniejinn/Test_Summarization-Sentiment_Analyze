Title : A reliance on conspiracies and rejection of logic and reason
Ariticle : 
The spread of COVID-19 is far from being a conspiracy. It is a reality and an entity that can cripple entire humanity. However, a myriad of people of Pakistan, ranging from poor to rich and educated to less educated, staunchly believe that the spread of COVID-19 is a weapon utilized by the West against the Muslims or biological warfare optimized by either China or America. Nevertheless, the proof of the pudding is in eating it; people will always mistrust science and disbelieve in the spread of this disease until they experience it themselves. In a nutshell, this mistrust in public authorities and sheer ignorance towards science can be disastrous.
