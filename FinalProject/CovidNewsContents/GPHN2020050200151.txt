Title : COVID-19 cases identified by zip code
Ariticle : 
Today (Friday), the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released an interactive map online showing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by zip code.
The Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald researched that database and reports the following cases (by town) in our local four counties:
Of Bertie County's 44 positive cases to date, the majority are in the Windsor area where the virus has affected 30 individuals and there has been one death. The only other Bertie County town with more than five cases is Colerain (6).
Hertford County's 39 cases as of Friday were largely confined to the Ahoskie (19) and Murfreesboro (9) zip codes. There had been one death in each of those areas of the county. The Como area has three cases.
NCDHHS is listing the outbreak of cases at Rivers Correctional Institution at 27 as of Friday. That number represents 21 inmates and six staff members.
Northampton County has the largest number (87) of confirmed cases in the local area. The Woodland zip code was listed with the highest number of cases (26, plus one death). NCDHHS listed Pine Forest Rest Home in Potecasi with 27 cases and one death. Twenty of those cases (along with the one death) involved residents at that facility.
The Rich Square zip code listed 10 cases and two deaths. According to the NCDHHS, Rich Square Nursing and Rehabilitation had six staff members and five residents test positive for the virus. Two of those residents passed away.
The Conway zip code also reported one death and 11 confirmed cases.
Other Northampton County zip codes reporting three or more confirmed cases were: Jackson (3), Lasker (3), Garysburg (4), Seaboard (5), and Gaston (17).
Of Gates County's seven confirmed cases, nearly one-half (3) are in the Gates zip code area.
