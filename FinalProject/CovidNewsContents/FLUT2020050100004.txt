Virus has mutated into 10 types, one now dominant across regions: Study

MUMBAI: The novel coronavirus, first reported in China in December 2019, has mutated into 10 different types and one of them — A2a — has nearly replaced all the others to become dominant across geographical regions, says a global study by an Indian institute.

The study, by Nidhan Biswas and Partha Majumder from the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in Kalyani, West Bengal, 
will soon be published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, a peer-reviewed medical journal published by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

The novel coronavirus with the A2a mutation is highly efficient in entering human lung cells in larger numbers. The previous SARS-CoV that killed 800 and infected 8,000 people 10 years ago was also adept in entering the lungs, but not as much as A2a. It is efficient in transmission and resultantly, Covid-19 became highly prevalent across all regions, wrote the authors.
 The study is crucial as it provides vaccine manufacturers with a specific target.

The 10 types have evolved from the ancestral type ‘O’ over four months. A2a started overtaking other types across the world by March-end. “It has became the dominant type of SARS-CoV2,” said Majumder.
The NIBG researchers used the RNA sequence data shared by Covid-19 researchers from across the world in a public database, GISAID. 
The team used RNA sequences of 3,600 coronaviruses collected from 55 countries from December 2019 to April 6, 2020....
