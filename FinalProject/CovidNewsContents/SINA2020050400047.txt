As a crew member was infected with the new coronavirus, the &quot;Mech 3&quot; cruise liner docked in Cuxhaven, northern Germany, took full isolation measures from April 28, including 58 Chinese crew members. It is understood that two of the 58 Chinese crew members have mild symptoms, and these two crew members had negative results in the first round of new coronavirus test. Du Xiaohui, Chinese Consul General in Hamburg, said, &quot;The Chinese Consulate General in Hamburg will take care of the 58 Chinese crew members in the end.&quot;
