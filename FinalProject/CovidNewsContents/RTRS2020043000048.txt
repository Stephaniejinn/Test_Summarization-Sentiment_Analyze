Title : India's Glenmark to conduct trials for potential COVID-19 drug, shares jump
Ariticle : 
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Shares of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd (
GLEN.NS
) rose almost 9% on Thursday after the Indian drugmaker got an approval to conduct clinical trials with antiviral drug favipiravir, seen as a potential treatment for COVID-19. 
Favipiravir, manufactured under the brand name Avigan by a unit of Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp (
4901.T
) and approved for use as an anti-flu drug in the Asian island country in 2014, has been effective, with no obvious side-effects, in helping coronavirus patients recover, a Chinese official told reporters at a news conference last month. 
"After having successfully developed the API and the formulations ... Glenmark is all geared to immediately begin clinical trials on favipiravir on COVID-19 patients in India," Sushrut Kulkarni, executive vice-president for Global R&D, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, said in a statement

The Drug Controller General of India, the country’s drug regulator, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment. 
On Wednesday, another Indian pharmaceutical company, Strides Pharma Science Ltd (
SRID.NS
), said it had developed and commercialized favipiravir antiviral tablets, and had applied to Indian drug authorities to start trials.   
Shares of Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, which rose as much as 8.9% to 359 rupees ($4.78), was trading up 5.9%, as of 0407 GMT.
