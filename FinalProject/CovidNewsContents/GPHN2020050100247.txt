The City of Hamilton is reporting 425 cases of COVID-19 in the community as of Wednesday (April 29) and 19 people have died so far as a result of the virus.
This marks an increase of just four cases in a 24-hour period.
Of the 425 cases, 247 have so far been resolved, which constitutes approximately 58 per cent of the city's cases.
Also, 65 of Hamilton's current cases are associated with active outbreaks at long-term care and congregate facilities across the city, of which there are 14.
The latest outbreak was declared Tuesday at St. Elizabeth's Villa on the West Mountain where one staff member has tested positive for the virus.
Also on Tuesday, it was confirmed that two health-care workers in the same department at the Juravinski Cancer Centre had tested positive for COVID-19 this week.
“Other healthcare workers who met exposure criteria with the two individuals are being notified,” a news release from Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) said.
“No patient contacts for these health-care workers have been identified.”
HHS said they were performing a deep clean of the department in which the staff members worked and were working towards ensuring that cancer treatments would not be halted.
There are 29 people in Hamilton hospitals currently being treated for COVID-19.
Ontario said as of Wednesday there are 347 new confirmed cases across the province, bringing the total to 15,728.
There have been 996 deaths associated with the virus and 9,612 cases have been resolved.
According to the province's coronavirus website, 264,594 people have been tested for the virus and 9,530 possible cases are under investigation and claims that 11,554 tests have been completed in the last day.
