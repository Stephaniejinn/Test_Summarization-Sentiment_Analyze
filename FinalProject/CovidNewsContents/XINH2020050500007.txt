PARIS -- France will provide 500 million euros (about 547 million U.S. dollars) for the global search for COVID-19 treatment and vaccines, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday after attending an online donor conference hosted by the European Commission.
"France will provide 500 million euros for the ACT-A initiative," Macron told reporters after the fundraising event which aimed at pooling resources worldwide to develop vaccines and effective treatments as quickly as possible and to make them universally available at affordable prices.
By "ACT-A initiative," the French president referred to the "(Access to COVID-19 Tools) Accelerator" initiative, an international collaboration launched by the World Health Organization on April 24 to accelerate the development, production and equitable distribution of new tools to fight COVID-19.

LONDON -- British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday that a coronavirus-tracing app will be trialled from Tuesday in the Isle of Wight as another 288 COVID-19 patients have died in Britain.
Chairing the Downing Street's daily press briefing, Hancock called on the public living on the island to download the National Health Service (NHS) contact-tracing app, expected to be rolled out more widely in the country later this month.
By doing so, they will be protecting themselves and the whole community, he told reporters.

ATHENS -- Greeks have started a gradual return to normalcy on Monday, with the partial lifting of the restrictive measures imposed on March 23 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Citizens no longer need to inform authorities about their visit to the pharmacy, the supermarket, or the park by sending a text message when leaving their home. A few stores opened on Monday, and more will follow in the coming weeks. Hotels are due to reopen on June 1.
However, officials and experts reiterated that people should continue to observe the prevention rules to "stay safe," which is the new buzzword in the government's public awareness campaign.

VIENNA -- After closing for seven weeks due to the COVID-19, Austrian schools reopened to graduating classes on Monday, with teachers and students trying to adapt to the new routine of wearing masks, washing hands frequently and keeping social distance.
In many schools, to guarantee social distancing, lessons were not held in the normal classroom, but in the gymnasium - for example in the Goethe Gymnasium, a general high school in Vienna, according to local media.
There, among other things, handrails on the stairs were glued with barrier tape, and strips for distance control were found on the floor. The hygiene rules and instructions for correct movement in the school building were clearly visible at the entrance.
