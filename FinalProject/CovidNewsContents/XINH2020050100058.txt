SHENZHEN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Wenqi, born in 1993, has a job in southern Chinese modern metropolis of Shenzhen. During the traditional lunar New Year holidays this year, Li returned for family reunion as usual to her hometown of Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
However, influenced by the sudden COVID-19 pandemic, Li couldn't travel back to Shenzhen after the holidays and had to stay at home like others in the country to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
When she heard from a friend that a local community lacked volunteers for its pandemic prevention work, Li filed for a checking post at the community. Every day, she worked nearly 12 hours to check the permits of vehicles into and out of the community.
As the pandemic wanes in the country, enterprises have been allowed to gradually restart business. On March 11, Li returned to Shenzhen and got back to work at a stereo speaker store. 
"During the pandemic, young generation, most of whom were born in the 1990s, made contributions to fight against the novel coronavirus, and I felt so proud as one of them," said Li.
