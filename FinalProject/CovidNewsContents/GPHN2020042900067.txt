Title : Coronavirus: Eight meat processing facilities have outbreaks; state death toll up 36 to 342
Ariticle : 
ELIZABETHTOWN — The morning following Bladen County's announcement its positive coronavirus cases have spiked to 18, North Carolina's death toll shot up by 36 to 342 on Tuesday.
Twenty-nine of those deaths were reported from congregate living settings. The Bladen Journal has also learned of three more counties in the state with meat processing plants that have outbreaks of COVID-19.
The state Department of Health and Human Services says 9,568 positive cases of the virus have been confirmed, and hospitalizations number 463. The deaths, cases and hospitalizations are all up significantly from the previous day's report.
Cases, up 312 on Monday, increased by 426 — including 215 from congregate living facilities.
Bladen County only counted 13 toward that number. Its Health Department on Monday night had confirmed eight more. Through the report of April 17, the county had just one.
Dr. Terri Duncan, director of the Health Department, has said previously county and state reports sometimes do not match because the state's numbers are frequently changing. In some instances, cases get reassigned to other counties after initial reports. There's been no change announced by the county from Monday's total of 18.
While the gross number of cases increased, the state reports that the number of tests coming back positive is decreasing and has for nearly two weeks. It is descending from a peak on April 18.
Hospitalizations have steadily increased after a surge between April 6, when there were 270, and April 10, when 423 set a new high. Since that day, the daily total has been above 400 on 13 occasions. The last eight reports, starting with April 21, have been 427, 434, 486, 477, 456, 451, 473 and 463.
In counties adjacent to Bladen, there are 18 deaths and 472 positive cases. Cumberland has seven deaths and 218 cases, Columbus has eight deaths and 94 cases, Robeson has three deaths and 106 cases, Sampson has 44 cases and Pender has 10 cases.
Outbreaks have been identified at 48 nursing homes, 20 residential care facilities, 13 correctional facilities and four other facilities. Of those, three are in Columbus, and one each are in Cumberland and Pender counties. The congregate living places account for 188 of the state's deaths, or 54.9 percent, and its lab-confirmed case count of 2,729 is 28.5 percent of the state total.
Bladen County is home to one of the meat processing facilities the DHHS has identified as having an outbreak. Its definition of an outbreak is two or more cases. The first case for a worker at the Smithfield Foods plant in Tar Heel was reported April 18.
Since an initial report from DHHS of five such facilities, at least three more have been added. They are in Wilkes, Union and Wilson counties. The first report said outbreaks were at plants in Bladen, Robeson, Duplin, Lee and Chatham counties.
In addition to the Smithfield plant in Tar Heel, cases have been confirmed at Lumber Bridge's Mountaire Farms plant in Robeson County, Siler City's Mountaire Farms plant in Chatham County, Mount Olive's Butterball plant in Duplin County, and at Sanford's Pilgrim's Pride plant in Lee County.
The only meat processing plant in Wilkes County is in Wilkesboro and operated by Tyson Farms, which also operates a plant in the Union County seat of Monroe. Smithfield Foods has a plant in Wilson County. It is unclear if positive cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at any of these three facilities.
