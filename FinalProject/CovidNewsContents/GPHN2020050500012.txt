Title : Japan may approve remdesivir for COVID-19 patients this week
Ariticle : 
TOKYO, May 4 -- U.S. biopharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences Inc. said Monday it applied with the Japanese health ministry for approval to use its anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat new coronavirus patients, paving the way for its clearance as early as this week.
Health minister Katsunobu Kato said Saturday he wants to give the green light "in about a week" after an application is made on remdesivir. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has authorized the emergency use of the drug for those hospitalized with severe illness caused by the virus.
If approved, remdesivir would be the first therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 patients in Japan.
The government has revised a Cabinet order so it can fast-track the process to authorize medicines for COVID-19 on condition such drugs have been approved in the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany or in France.
"While there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19, the investigational drug was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some patients," the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement on Friday.
Remdesivir was developed as a possible treatment for Ebola, but it has not been licensed or approved anywhere globally. Clinical trials have been under way to confirm the effectiveness and safety of its use for coronavirus patients around the world, including Japan.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday the government also intends to approve homegrown anti-flu drug Avigan to treat patients of COVID-19 later this month. A scientific study in China has shown its effectiveness in treating the disease.
