Today, Finance Minister, Bill Morneau, announced that Tiff Macklem will be appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada, effective June 3, 2020. Mr. Macklem will replace Stephen S. Poloz, who has led the Bank since 2013, and will be completing his seven-year term at its helm in early June.
Tiff Macklem is currently the Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, a role he assumed in July 2014. During his leadership at Rotman, Mr. Macklem has been a frequent speaker on the global financial system, risk management and public policy.  He has also chaired the Global Risk Institute.
Prior to joining Rotman, Mr. Macklem served as Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada from July 2010 until May 2014. He was also Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of Finance from 2007 to 2010, serving as Canada's representative at the G7, G20 and Financial Stability Board.
With Mr. Macklem’s appointment, the Bank of Canada will be well positioned to continue to lead its significant domestic and international contributions to the economic response, and eventual recovery, from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
