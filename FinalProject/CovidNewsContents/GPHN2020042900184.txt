Ariticle : 
Half of Canadians report worsening mental health amid coronavirus
While testing is being expanded, however, the health authority stresses that “not everyone needs a test” and that they aren’t recommended for individuals that aren’t showing symptoms.
VCH adds that while any individual can be tested, priority is still being given to the following groups of people:
Residents and staff of long-term care facilities
Individuals who require admission to hospital or are likely to be admitted
Individuals near term, patients on hemodialysis, or cancer patients receiving treatment
Healthcare workers
Individuals with a higher probability of being infected such as case contacts and travellers who recently returned to Canada
Residents of remote, isolated, or Indigenous communities
People living in congregate settings
People who are homeless or have unstable housing
Essential service providers
In order to arrange a test, residents are asked to contact their physician or practitioner’s office, or a local community collection centre.
Nearby facilities that are equipped for testing can be found online  or by calling 8-1-1.
