Patients suffering from chronic diseases will no longer have to worry about missing their meds, as the Interior Ministry has come up with a plan to deliver medicines at their doorsteps.
The campaign launched by the Department of Health and Social Affairs at the Ministry of Interior aims at delivering medicine to chronic disease patients, either at work or at home.
The move also forms part of reinforcing commitment to precautionary measures to reduce the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Volunteers from different department of the ministry are taking part in the initiative which has the theme “Your Health a Treasure”.
The department will soon launch the initiative electronically to ensure the health and safety of the ministry’s personnel. Abu Dhabi has also started a similar initiative to deliver medicine directly from pharmacies to the people there.
According to Emirates News Agency WAM, most of the outpatients in the emirate have the approval to avail the service. The service reportedly was launched to meet the needs of elderly and vulnerable patients and those living in remote areas.
