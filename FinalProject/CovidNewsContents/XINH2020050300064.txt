The Ugandan military suspended the rotation of its peacekeeping troops to Somalia and capacity building in Equatorial Guinea over COVID-19 pandemic. Uganda has some 6,000 troops serving under the AMISOM in Somalia and over 100 officers in Equatorial Guinea helping to build capacity and professionalization of the west African nation's army.
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan military has immediately suspended the rotation of its peacekeeping troops to Somalia and capacity building in Equatorial Guinea over COVID-19 pandemic, a spokesperson said Saturday.
Brig. Richard Karemire, Ugandan military spokesperson told Xinhua by telephone that Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) high command took a decision to protect thousands of troops in foreign missions.
The decision comes barely a week after a Ugandan peacekeeper serving under the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) tested positive for novel coronavirus in the capital, Mogadishu.

"It is one of the safety measures against COVID-19 taken in respect of UPDF troops deployed abroad in Somalia and Equatorial Guinea," said Karemire.
Somalia and Equatorial Guinea like Uganda are currently combating the novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak, which has infected hundreds of people.
Uganda has some 6,000 troops serving under the AMISOM in the Horn of African nation and over 100 officers in Equatorial Guinea helping to build capacity and professionalization of the west African nation's army.
The east African country deploys troops to Somalia and Equatorial Guinea on a one-year rotational basis.
