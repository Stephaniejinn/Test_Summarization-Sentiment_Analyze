Title : DNA could hamper virus treatment result
Ariticle : 
A DNA test could help identify people who will have adverse reactions to drugs being trialled against COVID-19.
An Australian company is pushing for its kits to be urgently included in national coronavirus clinical trials, including one by the Peter Doherty Institute at more than 70 hospitals, involving the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and HIV drug Kaletra.
There is also scope for whole genome testing of Australians who have had COVID-19 to see if genetics can explain why some people have the virus more severely than others.
MyDNA said a test it developed to find the best antidepressant for a patient and understand how the body reacts to 100 other medications could give insight into how a person’s body would process the malaria and HIV drugs.
These drugs can cause major health risks including heart damage, blindness and even death in some people.
Hyrdroxychloroquine has been in high demand after US President Donald Trump suggested it could be a cure for COVID-19.
MyDNA’s Professor Les Sheffield said hydroxychloroquine stays in the body for a long time, has a half-life of 40-50 days and the amount in the blood varies up to 10 times in different people.
Australian Medical Association spokesman Dr Chris Moy said the DNA test may be “one of several ducks” researchers needed to get in a row as they tried to find a treatment for COVID-19.
“Everyone has a slightly different way of breaking down medications and when you get a result from the test it will tell you if the drug is more likely to be retained in the body … if you don’t break it down it could be more toxic,” he said.The MyDNA test costs between $90 and $150.
