Finlay: So far, Canada's answer to COVID-19 mental health crisis doesn't measure up Back to video
World-renowned experts paint a dire picture. Nadine Kaslow, PhD, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University, told me, “the longer the pandemic crisis goes along and the more prolonged the social isolation, the more people are likely to think about suicide, attempt suicide, or die by suicide.”

Tragically, that’s already happening even in the health-care community. Last week, Dr. Lorna Breen, the popular and respected 49-year-old medical director of the emergency department at famed New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, died by suicide. The news sent shock waves throughout COVID-19 front lines in the U.S. and Canada.
Troubling signs have also been noticed by Sam Ozersky, a psychiatrist and lecturer at University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine. He tells me that “the social isolation, job loss and disruption to family life … will increase rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicide.” In a jarring prediction, he adds “it is possible that our attempts to contain the virus will cause more deaths than the virus itself.” Adding to the problem, our mental health care system was already moribund and paralyzed before the outbreak, he says.

Under-serving the mental health needs of Canadians carries on with the federal response to the pandemic. Instead of coming up with an imaginative action plan that matches the unprecedented scale of the threat, the federal government turned to a portal of largely off-the-shelf, commonly available resources which it re-packaged under the banner Wellness Together Canada . Surprisingly, there’s nothing in the tools and learning modules that even makes reference to super-stressed life in the time of COVID-19.
One disappointed visitor to the portal told me that after she admitted, in her answers to a series of online questions, that she had repeatedly thought of suicide, she got an automated message advising “it would be helpful to connect with a mental health professional.” But the site gave no information on how she was supposed to do that. A texting option also left her bewildered and wondering who exactly was at the other end.

Just as test kits, masks and other personal protective equipment are vital in combatting the spread of the virus, one-on-one, compassionate mental health counselling is absolutely essential in combatting its toxic impact on our emotional wellbeing. Canada needs a game changer in the way it is answering its national mental health crisis.
One part of that response should include the creation of what I’m calling the Canadian COVID-19 Mental Health Corps, involving a massive mobilization of clinical professionals, including psychologists also paid by the government, who would provide direct, virtual counselling through stepped-up, and well-promoted, tele-mental health platforms during the period of this public mental health emergency and its aftermath.
