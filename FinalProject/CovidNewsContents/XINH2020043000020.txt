Starbucks has temporarily closed about half of company-operated stores in the United States, while 98 percent of stores in China are open.
SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Starbucks on Tuesday said in a financial report that the consolidated net sales for its fiscal second quarter ended with 6 billion U.S. dollars, declining 5 percent from the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the report, the company's financial results for the 13-week second quarter, ending March 29, recorded a net income of 328.4 million dollars, or 28 cents per share, compared with 663.2 million dollars, or 53 cents per share, in the same period of 2019.
The company opened 255 new stores in the second quarter, yielding a 6-percent year-over-year unit growth, ending the period with 32,050 stores globally, of which 51 percent were company-operated, and the other 49 percent were licensed, said the report.
Stores in the United States and China comprised 61 percent of the company's global portfolio, with 15,257 and 4,351 stores respectively, it said.
"Currently, we have temporarily closed approximately 50 percent of our company-operated stores in the U.S., as well as more than 75 percent in Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom," the report said, adding that 98 percent of the company-operated stores in China are open, which are operating under modified schedules and enhanced safety-related protocols because of the pandemic.
"We are leveraging our experience in China to inform our actions in other markets, including the U.S., where we are now entering the 'monitor and adapt' phase to reopen many more stores with best-in-class safety protocols," said Kevin Johnson, Starbucks' president and CEO.
