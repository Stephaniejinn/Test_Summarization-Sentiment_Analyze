ZHENGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guangyao and Qiao Bing, a pair of lovers born in the 1990s, are both ICU nurses of the Third People's Hospital of Henan.
After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, both of them filed for aiding the fight against the disease in the hardest-hit Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei.
On Feb. 2, Liu and Qiao, both included in a provincial Wuhan-aiding medical team, left Henan for the city where they battled the novel coronavirus at local Tongji Hospital for nearly two months.
They originally planned to get engaged on Feb. 9, but they have to postpone it due to the pandemic. Unwilling to let the special day fleet like a normal one, however, Liu made a simple ring with a clip and proposed marriage to Qiao on that day.
After returning from Wuhan, Liu and Qiao went through a 14-day quarantine, and went back to their nursing work.
"After those unforgettable experiences in Wuhan, we both gained a deeper insight into our work now and would cherish our life more in the future. We have also planned to get married late this year or early in the next year," said Li.
