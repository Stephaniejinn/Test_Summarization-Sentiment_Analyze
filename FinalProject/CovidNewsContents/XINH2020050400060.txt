Police in Zimbabwe will arrest anyone leaving their homes without wearing face masks starting Monday, deputy minister of Information Energy Mutodi said.
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Police in Zimbabwe will arrest anyone leaving their homes without wearing face masks starting Monday, deputy minister of Information Energy Mutodi said on Sunday.
"With effect tomorrow Monday May 4, police will arrest anyone seen without putting on a mask in the CBD, entering shops or any public places," Mutodi announced on twitter.
The development follows President Emmerson Mnangagwa's announcement on Friday that members of the public will be required to wear face masks in all public spaces.
Mnangagwa also extended the lockdown which was meant to end on Sunday by two weeks but downgraded it to stage 2, allowing some industries to resume operations.
Zimbabwe has recorded 34 cases of COVID-19, including four deaths and five recovery cases as of Sunday.
