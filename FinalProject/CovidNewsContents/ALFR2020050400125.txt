Title : Angola: COVID-19 - Health Minister Warns of Coercive COVID-19 Testing
Ariticle : 
Luanda — Heath minister Sílvia Lutucutuca Saturday in Luanda warned of coercive test for all passengers who arrived on the 17th, 18th and 19th in Angola and missed out on massive voluntary testing.
The minister announced so at a press conference, stressing that if tracked down they are brought into mandatory institutional quarantine until they undergo tests.
The official put at between 10 to 15 passengers as having been missed the voluntary testing, running since May 1 at the National School of Public Health and at the Américo Boa Vida Hospital.
After announcing plans to release the results of specimens of 1,089 people, Silvia Lutucuta regretted the increase in positive cases of patients who were in home quarantine, after more than 30 days since they arrived in the country.
"The Commission has been working hard to track down these cases
as many of them provided wrong addresses or disconnected their phones," she said.
The minister admitted that positive cases in this situation may still occur, as recent scientific studies show that the incubation period may run until 50 days after the infection. This is the reason why the passengers mentioned are being tested.
The number of infections rose to 35, including two dead, 11 recovered and 22 active.
