Title : French doctors say they found a Covid-19 patient from December 2019
Ariticle : 
																							
There's new evidence that the 
coronavirus
 may have been in France weeks earlier than was previously thought.

Doctors at a Paris hospital say they've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid-19. If verified, this finding would show that 
the virus
 was already circulating in Europe at that time -- well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.

"Covid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country," the team at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint-Denis wrote in a study published Sunday in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.

SARS-COV-2 was already spreading in France in late December 2019



Highlights

•Covid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country.

•Early community spreading changes our knowledge of covid-19 epidemic.

•This new case changes our understanding of the epidemic and modeling studies should adjust to this new data.


Abstract

The COVID-19 epidemic is believed to have started in late January 2020 in France. We report here a case of a patient hospitalized in December 2019 in our intensive care, of our hospital in the north of Paris, for hemoptysis with no etiological diagnosis and for which RT-PCR was performed retrospectively on the stored respiratory sample which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Based on this result, it appears that the COVID-19 epidemic started much earlier.



	
		
			
							
We report an observation of a patient infected with COVID-19 one month before the first reported cases in our country. On admission, the patient presented clinical signs and radiological patterns frequently seen previously in the Chinese
12
 and Italian
13
 cohorts.
