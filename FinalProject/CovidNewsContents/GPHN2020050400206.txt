However, the authorities disclosed that the system only collects information from 475 of the units.
UNAM's COVID-19 Geographic Information Centre made its own estimates for the country. As a result, there were between 176,000 and 265,000 people infected in Mexico, almost double what the Mexican government estimated.
This number was obtained by specialists by multiplying cases by 8, as the authorities claim that it is made with the Sentinel model.
