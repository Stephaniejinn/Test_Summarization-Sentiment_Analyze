Title : He said &quot;Lincoln is crying&quot;
Ariticle : 
Original title: He started, &quot;Lincoln is crying&quot;
Trump confessed &quot;in front of Lincoln&quot;, and netizens did not agree.
&quot;We are confident that we will get the vaccine before the end of the year&quot;, &quot;The number of deaths from the new American pneumococcal pneumonia may be 80,000 or 90,000&quot; ... On May 3, local time, US President Trump was interviewed by Fox News at the Lincoln Memorial. Talk, but it was not &quot;confidence&quot; in his mouth that rushed on Twitter that day, but &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Because Trump &quot;took in front of Lincoln&quot; in the interview that he was &quot;hostile from the media&quot; and &quot;was treated worse than Lincoln.&quot; Some people have pictures of &quot;Lincoln crying&quot; for this, and others remind Trump that Lincoln was assassinated ...
In this interview, Trump said a lot of &quot;content&quot;, for example, he said that he is very confident that the United States will &quot;develop a new crown vaccine by the end of this year.&quot; He also renewed his estimate of the death toll for new coronary pneumonia in the United States, from the previous 100,000, to the subsequent 50-60,000, and then adjust the current 80,000-90,000.
Of course, he continued to dump the pot to China and WHO &quot;in front of Lincoln&quot; in the interview.
However, judging from the reaction of American netizens, they seem to care more about Trump&#39;s &quot;self-contrast Lincoln&quot; statement.
According to the US Capitol Hill report, a female audience member asked Trump why he avoided answering the reporter ’s questions directly at the news briefing about the New Crown Virus, but chose to “talk about some past achievements indiscriminately”?
Sitting in front of Lincoln, Trump defended himself like this: &quot;The hostility I have received in the media has never been seen by any president.&quot; He further stated, &quot;The closest thing is the gentleman there (referring to Lincoln). They always say that no one is treated worse than Lincoln. (But) I believe I was treated worse.
Trump also said, &quot;To be honest, the questions they asked me were shameful. Shameful!&quot; He continued, &quot;their expressions and language-I think if I were too friendly to them, I would be kicked Out of the (historical) stage. I mean, they asked you (me) the most terrible, excessive, and most biased question. &quot;
According to &quot;Capitol Hill&quot;, Trump then hurriedly listed a series of achievements during his administration, even if these achievements are not related to the new crown virus. Trump went on to say, &quot;... (This is) everything we do, but we are facing a very hostile media. I really appreciate this issue, and I understand the emotions behind it. But I Standing there, I did n’t (the reporter) ask me a normal question— (replaced by it) anger and hatred. I ’ll take a look at them. I ’ll say, &#39;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#39; &quot;
In American history, Abraham Lincoln was an extremely special president, not only because of his historical merits in the Civil War, but also because he was assassinated at only 56 years old. He was the first American president to be assassinated.
Regarding Trump&#39;s comparison of Lincoln and himself, some American netizens couldn&#39;t help mocking, &quot;Trump knows that Lincoln was assassinated, he complained too much!&quot; ↓
&quot;Guess whether Trump knew that Lincoln was assassinated? He complained too much! Don&#39;t say it.&quot;
&quot;Who will tell him (Trump) who is Abraham Lincoln?&quot;
&quot;I think Trump never knew how Lincoln&#39;s presidency ended.&quot;
Some netizens did not say anything, and directly put on an expression of &quot;Lincoln covering his face and crying&quot;. ↓
&quot;Lincoln cried.&quot;
&quot;I believe Lincoln must not agree ...&quot;
Some netizens sarcastically said that Lincoln &quot;responded&quot; to Trump, followed by a series of expression packages representing &quot;sweat death&quot;, &quot;smile cry&quot;, and &quot;tears&quot; ...
One of the American netizens who was praised and retweeted more wrote: &quot;I really don&#39;t think Trump knew that Lincoln was assassinated. Remember, he is the one who wishes us &#39;Happy Friday&#39;!&quot; &quot;

&quot;Change the mouth&quot; does not change the &quot;confidence&quot;, Trump estimates that the death of the new crown in the United States reaches 80,000 to 90,000 people: it is still successful
It&#39;s changed again. CNN reported on May 3 that US President Trump said on the same day that the number of new cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States may reach 80,000 to 90,000, which is a lot higher than his previous estimate. . But he still seems to be very satisfied with his &quot;results&quot; in epidemic prevention.
It is reported that Trump made this &quot;estimation&quot; on the &quot;Town Hall&quot; program on the 3rd of Fox News. At that time, he praised the US&#39;s response to the new crown epidemic.
&quot;If you say that losing 80,000 or 90,000 is still successful, then this (coping style) is one of the reasons for our success.&quot; Trump said.
And when asked about his constantly changing estimates, it was reported that Trump admitted, &quot;I used to say 65,000, and now I mean 80,000 or 90,000. Rising rapidly. &quot;
Since the outbreak of the New Crown epidemic in the United States, the number of infections has increased rapidly, and the number of deaths has also continued to rise. Trump has repeatedly given &quot;prediction data.&quot;
CNN said that Trump predicted at a White House press conference less than two weeks ago that the number of deaths from coronavirus in the United States will be between 50,000 and 60,000.
In March of this year, Trump had said that the number of deaths from the new crown in the United States could be as many as 100,000 or more. He also added that if the number of deaths remains within 100,000, then &quot;all of us are doing well.&quot;
On March 31, Deborah Burkes, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Response Working Group, presented a data model chart at the daily outbreak conference, estimating that the number of deaths from the new U.S. Coronary Pneumonia epidemic will surge in a few months From 100,000 to 240,000. Both Burkes and Anthony Fudge, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that this figure is &quot;very real&quot; and requires a clear mind and preparation. The model also shows that if Americans do not follow current prevention and control guidelines, the number of deaths may be higher than this prediction. If no measures are taken, up to 2.2 million people in the United States will die from new coronary pneumonia.
CNN reported that according to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of Sunday local time (May 3), there have been more than 1.1 million cases of new coronary pneumonia infection in the United States and more than 67,000 deaths. And as some states relax the &quot;home order&quot;, researchers predict that the number of people dying of the new coronavirus in the United States this summer will be higher than previously expected.
