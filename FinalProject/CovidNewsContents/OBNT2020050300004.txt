Ariticle :

In this video report, I look at the coronavirus disease, or COVID-19 outbreak situation in South America.
The last continent to report a case is now surpassed 200,000 and countries like Brazil, Peru and Ecuador are getting hit very hard today and some predict that the transmission rate will soon be the highest in the world.
I also look at some of the horror stories surrounding deaths in some of the hardest hit cities like Guayaquil, Manaos and Iquitos.
Lastly, Venezuela has reported very low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. How accurate are the data and is this a ticking time bomb waiting to explode?
