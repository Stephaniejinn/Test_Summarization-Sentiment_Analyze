Gon Coulibaly, 61, self-isolated in late March because of possible exposure to the coronavirus but did not test positive.
Defence Minister Hamed Bakayoko, who recovered from the virus last month, will serve as interim prime minister in Gon Coulibaly's absence, the statement said.
Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara designated Gon Coulibaly in March as the governing RHDP party's candidate for the presidential election after ruling out seeking a third term himself.
Ivory Coast has recorded more than 1,300 cases of the coronavirus, one of the highest totals in West Africa, and 15 deaths.
