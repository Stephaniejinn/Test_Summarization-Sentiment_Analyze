The VDH said 105,648 people have been tested for the virus in Virginia, and there have been 2,416 hospitalizations.
In the Richmond area, there are 1,951 cases: 898 in Henrico County, 557 in Chesterfield County, 364 in Richmond and 132 in Hanover County.

Fairfax County, the state's most populous locality with more than 1.1 million people, has the most cases with 3,897 and 137 deaths.
There are coronavirus cases in 130 of Virginia's 133 cities and counties. Only these 3 localities - Bath County, Bland County and Dickenson County - don't have cases.
State health officials have said there's a lag in the reporting of statewide numbers on the VDH website. Figures on the website might not include cases or deaths reported by localities or local health districts.
