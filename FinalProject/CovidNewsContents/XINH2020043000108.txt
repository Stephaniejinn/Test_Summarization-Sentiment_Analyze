MADRID, April 30 (Xinhua) -- FC Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic says he wants to start playing again and is even prepared to risk catching the coronavirus, Covid-19 to do so.
Speaking in Spanish sports paper, Diario Marca ahead of a possible return to individual training for Spain's professional footballers on May 4th, Rakitic said: "I want to play. It's obvious that we have to try and return with the best guarantees possible, but we have to know it is never going to be 100 percent."
"However, all of the workers who return to work are going to have some risk, supermarket employees have to get changed in dressing rooms and have the same chance of getting infected as well do."
"They are willing to take a risk and they accept it," said the midfielder.
Rakitic was asked if he was willing to be infected by the coronavirus and said "without doubt and I say that knowing the risk is very small, but also to show solidarity for those who have been risking themselves for us from the start of the crisis and I am sure they will do so for a lot longer."
"Football is very important for a lot of people and the proof of that is that it moves such a lot of money," said Rakitic.
