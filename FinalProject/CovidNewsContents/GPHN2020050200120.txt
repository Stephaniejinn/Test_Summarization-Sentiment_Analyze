More than half of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the Porcupine Health Unit area are women.
The health unit released its first epidemiological report Wednesday, which showed in all local cases confirmed between between March 1 and April 25, 53 per cent involved women and 47 per cent involved men. In total there were 31 women and 27 men who tested positive during that time for a total of 58 cases.
In that period of time, 36 positive cases or 62 per cent were located in Timmins while 21 cases or 36 per cent were in the broad area which PHU cites as “Cochrane, Matheson, Iroquois Falls and Smooth Rock Falls.” The Kapuskasing area only had one positive case, or two per cent.
Age ranges for positive cases varied, with the highest number of cases involving individuals between the ages of 60 and 79, for a total of 22 cases or 37.9 per cent.
There were 16 cases affecting those aged 40 to 59, or 27.6 per cent.
Other age groups included those between the ages of 20 and 39 which saw 12 cases or 20.7 per cent, and people aged 80 and over with six cases or 10.3 per cent.
There were only two cases affecting young people aged 19 and younger — representing 3.4 per cent of total cases in the area.
This means that almost half of all positive cases in the PHU region were over the age of 60, which is 48.2 per cent or 28 people. However, more than half were between the ages of 40 and 79 at 65.5 per cent, or 38 people.
In the PHU’s catchment area, there are a total of 86,000 residents, which Dr. Lianne Catton, medical officer of health for the health unit, said to keep in mind when looking at the data. With the area’s low population numbers and a smaller number of cases compared to other areas in the province, “It is very easy for these percentages and these rates to change quickly with very small changes in the number of cases or very small changes in the distribution of the age groups,” she explained.
“It is to provide some information and perspective on what we have so far, but with the numbers being so low, it is not something that can really be used to predict risk in particular groups or to make other broader statements or recommendations or guidance on.”
Over time, the data in the report shows that the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the health unit region spiked during the week of March 29 and April 5, which saw 21 new cases announced. It surged again in the week of April 12 to 19 which saw 10 new cases.
When looking at symptoms and their approximate date of onset, the data shows a shift backwards by two weeks, meaning cases began showing symptoms during the weeks of March 15 to 22 and March 22 to 29. Between March 15 and 22, around 12 people were experiencing symptoms, whereas the following week, March 22 to 29, about 15 people began to feel ill.
The onset date, which the health unit also refers to as the episode date, is calculated based on either the date when a case began to experience symptoms of the virus, the day when the person was swabbed or the date the individual contacted public health, explains the report. At the time of publishing the report, the PHU could not confirm the system onset date for one individual.
Cumulatively, the number of cases being reported began to steadily increase significantly after March 29. The majority of cases were announced between that date and April 25.
The upward trend of the graph also shows a robust incline in the number of cases at the onset of their symptoms with few stagnations, beginning as far back as the week of March 8, prior to the city’s declaration of a state of emergency and schools closing their doors to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among students.
The PHU’s case fatality rate as of April 25 was 5.2 per cent, with three deaths having been reported by that date. Throughout the province, the fatality rate was 5.8 per cent.
Likewise, by that date, the health unit saw 42 of its reported cases, or 72.4 per cent, be deemed as resolved, meaning they were no longer infectious. In Ontario, provincial health officials saw 7,509 resolved cases, or 53.7 per cent.
As previously reported by The Daily Press, the health unit’s testing rate across its catchment area was 2,014 swabs per 100,000 population, which Catton has previously said is above the rate of the province. Of those tests, 5.1 per cent were positive. In comparison, Ontario’s testing rate was 1,484.4 and its percentage of positive cases was 6.7.
Across all Northern Ontario health units, the PHU was testing far more people than the others and was seeing a higher percentage of positive cases. However, the Thunder Bay District Health Unit was not far behind as it was seeing 2.9 per cent of positive swabs, or 63 cases. The Timiskaming Health Unit was a close third at 2.3 per cent, or 12 cases.
Throughout the North, there were 228 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of April 25. Of those, five were deceased and the fatality rate was 2.2 per cent. Northern Ontario’s testing rate was 1,551.6 per 100,000 population and its percentage of positive tests was 2.2. Since then, the PHU has reported another death, the region’s fourth since the pandemic began.
On Thursday, the Porcupine Health Unit reported one new case of COVID-19 among residents.
That brought the number of positive cases to 60 in the health unit area.
A Timmins woman in her 40s is the 60th case. She is a close contact of another positive case and is at home in self-isolation. She was tested on Tuesday.
As of Thursday evening, the PHU had completed 1,942 tests, of which 60 were positive, and 553 were still under investigation. Of the 60 positive cases, 43 were resolved and four resulted in death.
