The ministry also indicated there are 2,751 confirmed cases among long-term care residents and 1,619 cases among staff.
Ontario officials have said there may be a discrepancy between overall deaths and deaths at long-term care homes due to how the province’s health database system, called iPHIS, is tracking data and how the Ministry of Long-Term Care is tracking data.
