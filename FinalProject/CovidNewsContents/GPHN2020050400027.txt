Title : Germany's COVID-19 Deaths Top 6,600
Ariticle : 
Germany has confirmed 793 new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 162,496, the Robert Koch Institute announced on Sunday. The death toll has risen by 74 to 6,649 people in the given period, Europe News reported
Over 130,000 COVID-19 patients have recovered in Germany since the beginning of the outbreak.
The most coronavirus cases have been recorded in Bavaria (42,792), North Rhine-Westphalia (33,428) and Baden-Wurttemberg (32,291). Berlin has 5,976 virus cases.
Germany, like Spain, Italy and a handful of other European countries, has tentatively started to lift its lockdown measures by allowing smaller retail stores to re-open as long as hygiene and social-distancing measures are maintained. Larger car dealerships, bike shops and book shops have also been allowed to open their doors.
The German economy will suffer the biggest slump in its history this year over the coronavirus crisis, the government warned on Wednesday, pushing Europe's top economy into a painful recession.
German gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink by a record 6.3 percent as demand for exports plummets and lockdown restrictions weigh on domestic consumption, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier stated.
Germany has long enjoyed record-low unemployment at around five percent, but this is expected to climb to 5.8 percent this year.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the coronavirus pandemic the biggest challenge to the “life and health of our people” since WWII. She also stated that the country is “not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning”.
