One more COVID-19 case has been confirmed by public health officials in Sarnia-Lambton, but the percentage of overall positive tests has dropped for the second day in a row.
Now only seven per cent of the 2,610 tests – 188 – have come back positive. Fourteen more people have recovered for a total of 110 and the number of deaths has remained at 14 since April 20.
There continues to be three institutional outbreaks at seniors’ homes, but no new cases connected to them in the last few days. Thirty Landmark Village residents and 10 staff have tested positive and six of the region’s deaths are linked to the Sarnia retirement home. Vision Nursing Home has four residents and two employees who’ve contracted the virus and Sumac Lodge is also in outbreak status after one staff member tested positive, health officials said. Both facilities are long-term care homes in Sarnia.
Lambton Meadowview Villa, a long-term care facility near Petrolia where one worker tested positive, had an outbreak that was declared over by public health officials after one week in late April.
Bluewater Health reported Sunday nine patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were being treated at the hospital, the same number as the previous two days. Another 20 patients with suspected cases were waiting for test results, five more than Saturday.
