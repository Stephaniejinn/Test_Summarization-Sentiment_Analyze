, the story of Dr. Michael Robert Marampe has sparked the social network of the country these days.
Michael has been involved in combating COVID-19 in Jakarta (Indonesia) since the outbreak. As the epidemic became more and more complex, the number of infected people and deaths in the country continued to increase, Michael whirled to treat patients.
In 2019, he and his girlfriend Tri Novia Septiani are engaged, scheduled to celebrate April 11 this year. Because of busy work on the front line, the young couple rescheduled their weddings and made an appointment when the pandemic passed through him and would &quot;take her to the palace&quot;.
Last week, however, Michael unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19, most likely due to a cross-infection from the patient. Michael was immediately taken to the intensive care ward in East Jakarta.
During his treatment, Michael regularly posted videos and positive status lines on social networks, encouraging his colleagues to fight against epidemics.
&quot;For me to be a doctor is an honor, I can serve patients, help so many people. I have no regrets,&quot; Michael wrote.
On the same day, Michael posted the final state with photos of his fianc√©e. To Michael, Tri has always been a supporter and side with him for over 8 years.
&quot;I love you, and know that I love you too. See you again,&quot; Tri wrote when she was told her husband was going to die.
According to the Indonesian Medical Association (IDI), Michael is one of 40 health workers, including 24 doctors and 16 nurses, who died of COVID-19 in the country so far.
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Indonesia is the highest in Southeast Asia with 773 people, while the number of infections is second with 9,500 people. Ranked number one in the region is still Singapore when it recorded nearly 15,000 cases as of April 29.
