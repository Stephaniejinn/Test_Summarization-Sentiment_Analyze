The World Health Organisation (WHO) on January 31, 2020 declared the disease a global health emergency.
"The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries," WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said at a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland.
The organisation subsequently declared the disease a pandemic on March 11 as it continued to spread across the world.
