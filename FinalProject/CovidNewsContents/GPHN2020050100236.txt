Title : County COVID-19 cases stay at 31
Ariticle : 
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday stayed at 31, including four deaths. No new cases have been reported since Tuesday evening.
Meanwhile, the new state-hosted walk-up test site at Shasta College began to see patients by appointment. It is one of 80 California is establishing to increase testing in underserved communities.
Tehama County health officials announced Wednesday their plans to launch similar testing sites in Red Bluff and Corning. To determine the locations, the state looked at areas where Californians would have to travel between 30 minutes to an hour to reach an existing testing site or hospital, according to a press release from Tehama officials.
To encourage social distancing, U.S. Forest Service officials in California extended their closure order for "most developed recreation sites" until May 15. The order had been set to expire Thursday. Lassen National Forest officials noted that trash removal and toilet facilities are currently closed.
