Title : Health official warns of epidemic rebound risks
Ariticle : 
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of existing confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland had dropped for 11 consecutive days as of Saturday, a Chinese health official said Sunday.
 The mainland reported 12 new asymptomatic cases on Saturday, the lowest figure since the daily report on COVID-19 cases included this figure, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the National Health Commission, at a press conference in Beijing.
 However, 10 provincial-level regions had reported new locally transmitted cases or asymptomatic cases over the last 14 days, which highlighted that risks of a resurgence and even spread of the epidemic still existed, Mi noted.
 "We need to keep highly vigilant and make epidemic prevention and control a part of our regular work agenda while advancing efforts to resume production and daily life," Mi added.
