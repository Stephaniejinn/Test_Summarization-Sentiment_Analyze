TORONTO --   Jack Peake’s son, currently on a cruise ship anchored off the coast of Florida, has not stepped foot on land in nearly two months. With Canadian and American ports currently closed to ships, he and many other Canadian crew members scattered on ships around the world are still waiting to come home.
According to Peake, crew members on his son’s ship, the Emerald Princess, have been told they are awaiting clearance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the American Coast Guard to allow them to land at an American or nearby foreign port and take flights home, but no timeline has been set. 
“For us, it’s concerning now that they can’t seem to figure out how to get him home,” said Peake.
The CDC issued a “ No Sail Order ” for all cruise ships last month, meaning all cruise ship operations were suspended from U.S. ports of call. Earlier this month, the CDC said there were 100 cruise ships anchored off the East, West and Gulf coasts with nearly 80,000 crew on board , and 20 ships at port or anchorage in the U.S. with known or suspected COVID-19 infections among the crew.
There are currently 11 cruise ships docked or anchored off the coast of Florida carrying Canadian crew. According to Peake, the crew on the ships that his son was aboard have been quarantined and cleared of infection.
