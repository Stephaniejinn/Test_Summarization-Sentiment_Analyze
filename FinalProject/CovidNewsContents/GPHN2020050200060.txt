Hastings Prince Edward Public Health are looking at integrating Ontario’s phased plan to reopen the province during the COVID-19 pandemic horizontally, Dr. Ethan Toumishey said during Thursday’s weekly Facebook Live presentation.
“The province has recently announced a phased approach to reopening the province. Locally, at Hastings and Prince Edward Public Health, we’re looking at integrating that horizontally, so we’re looking at crafting something that makes sense in a regional context with our surrounding partners while paying close attention to what framework we’re seeing from the province with regards to legislation.
“We’re working on a plan right now and looking forward to having more details available as we continue to watch, ideally, the progress that we’re making against COVID-19 and how we keep the community safe,” said Toumishey.
As of Thursday morning there were 52,056 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, 16,187 cases in Ontario, and in Hastings and Prince Edward Counties there were 41 total confirmed cases, including two new cases. As of Thursday there have been four COVID-19 deaths, including two recent deaths at long-term care facilities. Facility-wide outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported at Hastings Manor and Belmont Long Term Care Facility in Belleville, and at Moira Place in Tweed.
“There are 215 probable cases in Hastings and Prince Edward counties, once again these numbers have been fairly stable as far as probable cases are concerned. Over 2,544 tests have been administered locally. I would really like to highlight what we’ve done, as well as our community partners from paramedics, hospitals, long-term care and other healthcare providers, making testing available within our area,” said Toumishey.
All of this information is available with more detail on Public Health’s continually updated COVID-19 dashboard at https://hpepublichealth.ca/. It is updated daily at 11 a.m.
Public health is working with local Ontario health partners such as hospitals and primary care providers to ensure that the assessment and testing is available. Individuals can self refer to a local assessment centre by calling the COVID-19 Hotline at 613-961-5544 or in the Bancroft area you can call 613-332-2825, ext. 2222 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Assessment centres are currently operating in Bancroft, Belleville and Picton. If individuals are unsure if testing is required or are concerned about accessing an assessment centre they can access the website for more information, contact the COVID-19 information line at 613-966-5500 or 1-800-267-2803, call TeleHealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000, or speak to your primary care provider.
“We’re supporting our Ontario partners in trying to slow the spread of COVID-19. In long-term care homes there has been an implementation of more enhanced testing measures for workers and residents of long-term care and that’s part of the overall strategy of administering the infection prevention control practices and safety measurements regarding transfers and admissions to help protect our community members,” Toumishey said.
He said the employer information package has had some updates, including the addition of new symptoms for self assessment, new signage which includes these additional symptoms, updated key messages from employers. This is available through the website.
“It’s a great resource for workplaces,” he said.
At this time all residents are being advised to continue practising public health protocols such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and staying at home as much as possible to reduce exposure and help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community.
