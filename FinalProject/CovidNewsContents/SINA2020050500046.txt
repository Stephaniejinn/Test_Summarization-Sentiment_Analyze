Original title: Many countries in the world pledged 8 billion US dollars to develop new crown vaccine
[Overseas website May 5 | Full-time epidemic time zone] According to CNN reports, on May 4th, the “International Pledge Conference on New Coronary Pneumonia Epidemic” co-sponsored by the European Union and relevant countries was held online. USD 8 billion will be used for the research and development of new coronavirus vaccines, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of new coronary pneumonia. European Commission President Von Delaine said that the world has shown a spirit of solidarity for the common good.
According to reports, representatives from many countries and international organizations including China, France, and the United Kingdom have participated in the conference. The earlier suspension of the WHO-funded United States did not participate in this event, raising public opinion.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that two senior US government officials claimed on the 4th that &quot;the United States is leading the global fight against the new crown virus&quot;, but declined to disclose why it was absent. The report also criticized that the multilateral efforts of various countries shown in this pledging activity are in stark contrast to the lonely road the United States is taking.
