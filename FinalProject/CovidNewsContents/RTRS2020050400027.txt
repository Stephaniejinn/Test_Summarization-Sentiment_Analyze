Title : New Zealand's Ardern asks citizens to follow virus-linked curbs even as no new cases reported
Ariticle : 
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern asked citizens to stay the course on social restrictions still in place to contain the coronavirus, and said no decision had been taken yet on whether the measures would be further eased. 
New Zealand on Monday reported no new cases of COVID-19 for the first time since March 16.  
Ardern also said she has accepted an invitation from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to attend Australia’s emergency coronavirus cabinet on Tuesday, where she would discuss creation of a “travel bubble” between the two countries.
