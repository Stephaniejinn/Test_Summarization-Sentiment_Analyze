Title : As Coronavirus Restrictions Ease, People Slowly Emerge From Homes; Chinese travelers gathered at tourist sites over holiday, but India reported its biggest daily increase in confirmed cases
Ariticle : 
China reported just two new coronavirus cases as millions of citizens flocked to tourist sites over a national holiday, with people across the world savoring the opportunity to foray outside as restrictions ease.
There were some 23 million travelers out and about at the start of a five-day holiday in China that runs through Tuesday, the country's Xinhua News Agency said, with attractions such as Beijing's Forbidden City partially reopened.
While a far cry from the numbers that would have been out and about during the holiday in years past, it is a sign that normal life is returning in the country where the virus first emerged late last year. The government has now reported only three new cases in the past two days.
But India, despite a monthlong lockdown, reported its biggest one-day increase in confirmed cases, showing ongoing infections remain a threat. The South Asian nation said Sunday that it had recorded more than 2,600 new infections, bringing its total to nearly 40,000 with more than 1,300 dead. The nationwide lockdown will remain in place until May 18.

Confirmed coronavirus cases world-wide Sunday exceeded 3.4 million, with more than 243,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The U.S. accounted for about a third of global infections with more than 1.1 million cases, and about a quarter of total deaths, at 66,385, according to Johns Hopkins. More than 26,500 new cases were reported across the U.S. in the 24 hours to 8 p.m. Saturday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data.
Governors in at least 30 U.S. states have started to allow some businesses to operate or announced plans to do so this month, as restrictions hit their economies. Epidemiologists say it is too soon to tell whether the lifting of the lockdowns, such as an ambitious effort to reopen in Georgia, will cause infection rates to rise.
As warmer spring temperatures lure residents to parks and beaches, even authorities in hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey are opening up outdoor spaces—though often with extra police present to ensure residents don't congregate too closely.
"Remember, no large gatherings!" NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan wrote on Twitter, along with a video showing police officers on bicycles wearing facial masks and riding through a park.
In the Philippines, all commercial flights to and from the country were suspended as of Sunday morning to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the Manila International Airport Authority posted on its Facebook page, citing directions from the government's Covid-19 task force. Cargo and medical-related flights are unaffected. The country has recorded 9,223 infections and 607 deaths, according to government data.

South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday reported six new cases of the coronavirus, continuing a downward trend after two months of strict social distancing. Singapore, which has struggled to halt rising infections in the city-state, reported 657 new cases Sunday.
Australia recorded two coronavirus deaths to take its tally to 95 from 6,800 cases. The country's chief medical officer on Sunday said 4.25 million of an estimated 16 million adult smartphone users had downloaded a government app tracking the spread of the coronavirus. Brendan Murphy told a media conference that app data showed people's movement had increased in recent days as some states relaxed restrictions.
Mr. Murphy said a restart of university activities would be discussed this week by Australia's national cabinet of federal and state leaders. He said some face-to-face activities are likely to resume, but stressed social-distancing measures would remain in place for months. "Over the next month as we start to get back to normal, we still have to be incredibly, incredibly careful. The virus is still among us," he said.
