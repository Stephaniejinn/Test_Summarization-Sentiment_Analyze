Title : Temporal rise in the proportion of younger adults and older... -
Ariticle : 
  Using data on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Germany from the Robert Koch Institute, we found a relative increase with time in the prevalence in 15   34 year-olds (particularly 20   24-year-olds) compared with 35   49- and 10   14-year-olds (we excluded older and younger ages because of different healthcare seeking behaviour). This suggests an elevated role for that age group in propagating the epidemic following the introduction of physical distancing measures.
