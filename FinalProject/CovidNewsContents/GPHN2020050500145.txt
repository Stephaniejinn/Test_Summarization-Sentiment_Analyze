Title : Clinical Trial: Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in the Early Care of COVID-19 Patients
Ariticle : 
U.S., May 5 -- ClinicalTrials.gov registry received information related to the study (NCT04372979) titled 'Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in the Early Care of COVID-19 Patients' on April 24.
Brief Summary: COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) hospitalized patients evolution is marked by the risk of worsening of the respiratory system during the second week of the disease. To date, treatments are currently being evaluated and none of them have shown to be effective in the care of these patients. The use of convalescent plasma is a passive immunotherapy. It has often been used in respiratory virus epidemic situations (during the 1918 or 2009 influenza pandemic, or during SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV pandemic). Effects reported in literature are in favour of a beneficial impact of transfusion of these plasma without serious adverse effects reported.
PlasCoSSA is a randomized, controlled, triple-blinded, parallel clinical trial. This study tests the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion therapy in the early care of COVID-19 hospitalized patients outside intensive care units.
