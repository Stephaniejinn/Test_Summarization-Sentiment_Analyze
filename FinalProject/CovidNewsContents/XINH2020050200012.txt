Of the 100,943 infected, 1,578 are in intensive care (down by 116 compared to the day before) and 17,569 are hospitalized in normal wards (down by 580). The rest, or more than 80 percent of those who tested positive, is in isolation at home.
Italy entered into a national lockdown on March 10 to contain the pandemic. The lockdown, expected to last until May 3, will be followed by a so-called "Phase Two," which involves the gradual resumption of social, economic and productive activities.
Beginning on May 4, the country's manufacturing, construction, and wholesale sectors can resume work, followed by retailers, museums, galleries and libraries on May 18, and bars, restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons on June 1. All businesses will have to follow rigorous workplace safety protocols.
