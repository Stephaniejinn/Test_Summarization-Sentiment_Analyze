Title : UK scientists test experimental drug which could 'significantly improve' health of coronavirus patients
Ariticle : 
UK scientists have started testing an experimental Covid-19 drug which they hope will significantly improve the health of coronavirus patients.
The treatment, known as SNG-001, has been shown to stimulate immune response in the lungs of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease during trials.
The procedure uses the naturally occurring protein called interferon-beta which our bodies produce when we get a viral infection.
BBC Panorama gained access to the research at University Hospital Southampton.
The treatment would face further tough checks before it can be used routinely on patients even if the trial is a success.
BBC Panorama: When Will We Be Safe? will air on Monday, May 4 at 7.30pm on BBC One.
