COVID-19: Number of cases in Ontario continues to rise, province reports on Saturday Back to video
Ontario
The latest statistics: The number of new cases of COVID-19 in the province has risen by 511, the Ontario Ministry of Health reported Saturday. That is an increase from both Friday, when 421 new cases were confirmed, and from Thursday, when 459 cases were confirmed.
The daily report Saturday showed that 55 more people have died from the disease, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,176. The number of deaths reported on Friday was 39, and there were 86 deaths the day before. The majority of deaths have been in the province’s long-term care homes, where 910 residents and five staff have died.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 reported in the province stands at 17,119, although that statistic should be viewed with caution. Many people who have the disease experience only mild symptoms and don’t know they are infected, and testing is not widespread.

The number of tests for COVID-19 completed on Friday was 16,305, down slightly from the 16,532 tests conducted the day before.
Across the province, 977 people have been hospitalized for the illness, with 221 of those patients in intensive care and 154 people on ventilators, according to the latest report on Saturday.
Cautious optimism about re-opening as demonstrators converge on Queen’s Park:Premier Doug Ford has once again criticized anti-lockdown protesters, a smattering of whom gathered at Queen’s Park Saturday for the second week in a row. At his Saturday news conference, Ford said the protestors are putting their own lives at risk.

He said he was particularly upset by a demonstrator holding a Canadian flag upside down, saying it was disrespectful to the military. He understands that people are frustrated, and respects their right to protest, said Ford. However, he said he’d be the first to help the upside-down flag-bearers pack their bags and find another country.
Ford was cautiously optimistic about when the province can ease restrictions while saying it’s too soon to be specific about times.  He said Ontario is on a “gradual downward slope.” If the situation continues to improve for “a couple of weeks” the province can “open up a little bit,” he said. At the same time Ford cautioned that he doesn’t have a “magic clock” to predict how quickly things will re-open. “If we keep going the way we are going we are going to get out of this a lot sooner” than predicted a few months ago, he said.

Spring floods: Provincial officials say COVID-19 presents unique challenges for the spring flooding season, but they are prepared. The risk of flooding in southern Ontario is low and  there has been some minor flooding this week in northeastern Ontario, but water levels are high around the Great Lakes and there is a high risk of flooding along the James and Hudson Bay coast, John Yakabuski, minister of natural resources and forestry, said at the Saturday news conference.
Ottawa
Long-term care homes: The number of employees infected with COVID-19 at the city-run Peter D. Clark Centre long-term care home has increased, the city of Ottawa reported late Friday night.

Two residents and five employees at the Peter D. Clark Centre have now tested positive, general manager of community and social services Donna Gray said in a memo.
That was updated from a Friday morning memo from Gray, when two staff and two residents had tested positive.
In the morning memo, Gray said the residents are stable and being monitored by medical staff, and are isolated from other residents. To prevent the virus from spreading inside the Peter D. Clark Centre, staff have been assigned to one unit whenever possible and their movement around the centre is limited during a shift.
Donate your PPE: The city of Ottawa is holding a drop-off on Saturday for anyone who has personal protective equipment they can donate for use by health-care workers. Items can be taken to 1050 Morrison Drive from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Canada
Across Canada, the total number of COVID-19 cases now stands at 55,572, with 3,446 deaths and 23,329 cases resolved, Canadian health officials reported Saturday. The total number of cases the day before was 55,061.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his ministers and top public health officials are taking a rare break Saturday from the daily briefings they’ve been providing since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down Canada in mid-March.
Since the outbreak hit Canada, it’s become routine for Trudeau to provide daily briefings and take questions from reporters, followed by a separate briefing and question-and-answer session with Tam, her deputy, Dr. Howard Njoo, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and other ministers.

Prior to today, that routine has been broken only rarely — on Easter Sunday and last Sunday.
Quebec
Quebec is reporting 114 new deaths linked to COVID-19 today, bringing the death toll to 2,136, officials said Saturday.
The province’s Health Department said  in a statement that an additional 1,008 confirmed cases had been reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the number of those infected to 29,656.
Of those cases, 1,738 have required hospitalization, with 222 people in intensive care.
Quebec has announced plans to gradually reopen daycares, elementary schools, retail businesses, construction and manufacturing gradually during the month of May.

Authorities are staggering opening dates between the rest of the province and greater Montreal, which has been heavily hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The province also wants to ramp up testing to 14,000 tests per day in anticipation of the gradual resumption of activities.
Other provinces
New Brunswick officials reported Saturday that that the province had no new confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of the 118 people with confirmed cases of the illness, 116 have recovered. No patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19.
It has now been two weeks since the province reported fresh COVID-19 cases. However, health officials warned residents not to let their guard down and to abide by social distancing rules. The province has relaxed restrictions to allow households to socialize with one other family, creating a two-family “bubble.”

Newfoundland and Labrador also reported no new cases. That province had 259 confirmed cases, most of them in the Eastern Health area, which includes St. John’s.
World
The United Kingdom‘s COVID-19 death toll rose 621 to 28,131 as of May 1, just short of Italy, which has had the deadliest novel coronavirus outbreak among European countries. “Sadly of those tested positive for coronavirus… 28,131 have now died,” housing minister Robert Jenrick told reporters at a Downing Street briefing. “That’s an increase of 621 fatalities since yesterday.”
Italy reported a death toll of 28,236 on May 1. The United Kingdom’s previous death toll was 27,510 as of April 30 at 1600.

Meanwhile, other European countries are lifting restrictions. In Austria, people flocked to newly reopened hairdressers, beauticians and electronics shops on Saturday, as they relished the loosening of a seven-week-old coronavirus lockdown, although the move could yet cause a rebound in infections.
The Alpine republic acted early in its outbreak to close restaurants, bars, theaters, schools, non-essential shops and other gathering places, which helped reduce the daily increase in infections to less than one per cent. Austria has reported about 15,500 cases and 589 deaths so far.
The conservative-led government has said those relatively low numbers justify a phased reopening. The second phase – shopping centers, larger shops and service providers including hairdressers – began on Friday, a public holiday, meaning almost all those reopened on Saturday. In Vienna, hairdressers and clients wore face masks, which are required in shops and on public transport.
