Title : Botswana: Lodge Accommodates Health Personnel
Ariticle : 
Molepolole â€” Ranks Residence has accommodated health personnel from Scottish Livingstone Hospital as its contribution towards the fight against COVID-19.
The Molepolole-based lodge manager, Ms Abigail Rankokwane, said through the gesture, they were assisting government to reduce the spread of the virus.
She noted that health workers were at a higher risk of contracting the virus, saying that they should be kept in a safe environment.
She added that it would also ensure that no contagious diseases were passed to their families.
Ms Rankokwane also said they had measures in place to ensure maximum guest satisfaction and safety as well as to ensure compliance with health regulations. Employees, she said, were provided with personal protective clothing (PPE) to ensure that both guests and workers were protected.
She said loge workers were also sensitised on COVID-19 through discussions and sharing information from the Ministry of Health and Wellness. She added that they were also trained on the use of PPE and handling cleaning chemicals. "Sanitisers are also placed in each room and some areas around the facility," she said
The manager noted that everyone at the lodge observed social distancing at all times and washed their hands with soap regularly.
She also said guests were provided with meals in their rooms and that disinfectants were used to clean rooms.
Ranks Residence started operating last year and the total cost of accommodating the health workers is over P77 000.
