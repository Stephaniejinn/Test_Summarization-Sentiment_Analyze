Title : RISK NOTE: Chilean protests likely to re-emerge as COVID-19 virus-related lockdown is lifted throughout May, raising property damage risks
Ariticle : 
During the anniversary of the police force (“Día del Carabinero”) on 27 April there were at least 20 violent incidents in Chile, despite the confinement measures in place. Many took place during curfew (22:00–05:00).
* In Santiago, anti-government demonstrators erected barricades and threw Molotov cocktails in Pedro Aguirre Cerda, Lo Prado, San Joaquín, Estación Central, Huechuraba, Peñalolén, Cerro Navia, and Maipú. There were confrontations between demonstrators and the police in Plaza Italia/Plaza Baquedano, and attacks on police stations in Peñalolén and La Cisterna with incendiary devices or blunt objects. In La Florida, police officers in plain clothes and under the influence of alcohol shot at a group of 15 demonstrators on Avenida Vicuña Mackenna and Trinidad, injuring 10. The officers were subsequently discharged.
* In Cachimba del Agua, Antofagasta, there was an arson attempt against an office building and a vehicle was burnt. There were also barricades and confrontations in the city centres of Concepción and Valparaíso, and roadblocks in Talca, Curicó, San Felipe, Copiapó, Quilpué, and San Antonio.
* The number of violent anti-government protests, which started in October 2019 (see Chile: 16 March 2020: Violent-incidents spike raises arson and looting risks during Chile’s protests, but uninterrupted and widespread violence unlikely), had significantly receded since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus-related confinement measures were implemented in mid-March. The risk of protest-related violence is likely to re-emerge as the authorities started to lift restrictions on 27 April. Hotspots are Santiago city centre and industrial or low-income areas such as Pudahuel, Renca, La Granja, La Pintana, and Puente Alto, as well as the cities of Antofagasta,Concepción, and Valparaíso.
* Public buses, government buildings, and police stations are likely targets of arson, while retail stores and pharmacies are targets of looting. Commercial assets, such as bank branches and offices, are likely to be vandalised, with graffiti or windows being broken. However, uninterrupted and widespread violence as seen in late 2019 is unlikely. Incidents are likely to be more localised, gather fewer number of demonstrators (in the tens or hundreds), and last for a few hours. Enhanced police deployment and protocols are likely to help prevent violence from escalating.
