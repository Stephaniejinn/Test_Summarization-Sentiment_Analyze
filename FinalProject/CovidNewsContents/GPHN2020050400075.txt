Title : US'S FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZES EMERGENCY USE OF EBOLA DRUG REMDESIVIR FOR TREATMENT OF CORONAVIRUS
Ariticle : 
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, May 2 -- Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corp. issued the following news:
The US's Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the coronavirus. The authorization means the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalized with severe Covid-19. A recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill. But emergency FDA authorization is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review.
