Just now, US President Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel that the new coronavirus vaccine came out at the end of the year.
According to another observer network report:
On the evening of the 3rd local time, US President Trump said in an interview with &quot;Fox News&quot; in the hall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, &quot;We are confident that a new crown vaccine will be made by the end of 2020.&quot;
Trump said in the White House Oval Office on April 30 that the United States is rapidly developing a new crown vaccine. This project will cost billions, most of which will be borne by taxpayers. The goal is to prepare 100 million doses by the end of 2020 vaccine. However, US health officials have repeatedly emphasized that the vaccine development time is 12 to 18 months, which means that the new crown vaccine may not be developed until the end of 2020 or mid-2021.
Just before the start of this interview, according to the global real-time statistics system for new coronary pneumonia data released by Johns Hopkins University, as of May 3, EST, the United States reported that new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed 1154621. There were 67,451 deaths and 7051448 cases were tested. In the past 24 hours, there were 28,102 new diagnoses and 1,400 new deaths in the United States.
In New York State, where the epidemic is most severe, the cumulative number of diagnoses reached 316,415 on the 3rd, with a cumulative death of 24,708. There are currently 20 states with more than 10,000 people diagnosed in the United States, with more than 50,000 people diagnosed in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California and Pennsylvania.
New York State Governor Como said that as of 1st, New York State had received a total of 15,000 people tested for new coronavirus antibodies, and about 12.3% had antibodies, indicating that they had been infected with new coronavirus. Among them, New Yorkers had an antibody rate of 19.9%.
