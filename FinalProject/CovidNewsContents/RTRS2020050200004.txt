Title : U.S. airlines mandating facial coverings for all passengers
Ariticle : 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest U.S. airlines are moving rapidly to mandate facial coverings for all passengers, with Southwest Airlines Co (
LUV.N
) and Alaska Airlines (
ALK.N
) on Friday joining other major airlines in imposing the measure to address the spread of the coronavirus and convince reluctant passengers to resume flying. 
United Airlines (
UAL.O
), Delta Air Lines Inc (
DAL.N
) and American Airlines Group Inc (
AAL.O
), along with the smaller Frontier Airlines, which is owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC, announced Thursday that they would require facial coverings next month following JetBlue Airways Corp (
JBLU.O
). Some airlines, like Southwest, will provide masks if passengers forget to bring them on board as they announce new cleaning procedures to reassure consumers.
