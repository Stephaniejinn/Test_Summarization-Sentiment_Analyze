Title : Froedtert expected to test promising antiviral treatment; Confirmed coronavirus cases approach 8,000 in state
Ariticle : 
The state Department of Health Services on Sunday reported 304 new cases of COVID-19 and four more deaths as Wisconsin closed in on 8,000 confirmed positive tests during the pandemic.
The statewide total of 7,964 cases included four more deaths, bringing that total to 339. Almost 80,000 people have tested negative for the virus.
According to the DHS, Milwaukee County remains by far the leader in confirmed cases with 3,244, followed by 1,358 in Brown County.
Kenosha County (534), Dane County (436) and Racine County (435) have experienced similar numbers of confirmed positive tests.
Only five counties have had no confirmed cases: Burnett, Forest, Langlade, Pepin and Taylor.
Gov. Tony Evers announced Sunday that the Wisconsin National Guard will assist state and local health officials in conducting community testing events in northwestern counties in the state that have had insufficient testing or high rates of COVID-19.
Here are the dates and sites of those new community tests:
May 3-4, St. Croix Casino Turtle Lake Campground, 122 Tamarack St., Turtle Lake, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
May 5, Burnett County Highway Shop, 8150 State Road 70, Siren, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
May 6, Solon Springs Community Center, 11523 Business Highway 53, Solon Springs, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
May 7, Lake Superior Elementary School, 1101 Binsfield Road, Ashland, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
May 8, Western Wisconsin Health, 1100 Bergslien St., Baldwin, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
May 9, St. Croix Valley Business Innovation Center, 1091 Sutherland Ave., River Falls, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
May 10-11, CVTC/Prevea Health, 617 W. Clairemont Ave., Eau Claire, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (May 10); 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. (May 11).
May 13, Thorp High School, 605 S. Clark St., Thorp, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
May 14, Rusk County Fairgrounds, Rusk County Fairgrounds Road, Ladysmith, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Almost 3.5 million cases of the virus have been confirmed across the globe, according to the case dashboard at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. That figure includes nearly 1.2 million in the U.S.
As various clinical trials test methods of treating COVID-19 and, hopefully, a vaccine at some point, the antiviral drug remdesivir continues to yield encouraging results.
A clinical trial of 1,063 patients found those who took the drug were more likely to recover faster, by as much as 31%, than those taking a placebo.
The drug will become available for U.S. hospitals in the coming week.
The CEO of Gilead Sciences said the biotech company producing the drug has donated 1.5 million vials to the U.S. government, enough to treat 150,000 to 200,000 patients.
Federal health officials will distribute the drug to hospitals.
"They will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week and be adjusting that as the epidemic shifts and evolves in different cities," Daniel O'Day, Gilead's CEO and chairman, said Sunday on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Froedtert Hospital last week announced plans to give the drug to 10 severely ill COVID-19 patients who meet a very specific criteria set by Gilead.
"I am encouraged by it," said Mary Beth Graham, associate chief of the division of infectious disease at the Medical College of Wisconsin and director of infection prevention and control at Froedtert.
Dan Shirley, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases at UW Health in Madison, read the preliminary results and said, "they seem to be very positive." Shirley said the drug was a logical choice because it had shown benefits in a lab dish against other coronaviruses.
As potential treatments make their way to patients, Wisconsin health workers are receiving another influx of personal protective equipment.
Evers on Sunday announced that Wisconsin has received 10,000 procedural masks and 1,000 medical outfits from its "sister state" in China, Heilongjiang Province.
The state and Heilongjiang have had a long-standing relationship, celebrated in 2017 with the Wisconsin Development of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and U.S. Consulate in Shenyang.
