QuestDirect offers COVID-19 antibody testing online
Individuals can now purchase COVID-19 antibody testing online, without visiting a doctor's office, through QuestDirect, the consumer-initiated testing business of Quest Diagnostics, the lab announced in a news release. The new service broadens access to COVID-19 antibody testing in the United States.
Results are for the detection of SARS CoV-2 antibodies only. Antibody testing is not intended for use in individuals with an active COVID-19 infection, including individuals with symptoms. Patients suspected of having COVID-19 may not visit Quest patient service centers, which are not equipped to collect specimens for COVID-19 diagnostic testing.
Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. A positive result from the antibodies test does not guarantee that you had COVID-19, and a negative result doesn't rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection.
COVID-19 antibody testing may indicate whether the person has been exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean that person has some immunity to the coronavirus, said the FDA.
"While the science on COVID-19 is evolving, testing for antibodies may identify people who have likely been exposed to COVID-19 and might have mounted an immune response to the virus," said Dr. Jay Wohlgemuth, chief medical officer for Quest Diagnostics.
For the safety of patients and employees, individuals must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days, wear a face mask and pass a contact-less temperature check.
Details
The Quest antibody testing was developed with Abbott and Euroimmun/Perkin Elmer. The test received an FDA emergency use authorization and has not been reviewed by the FDA. The antibody test is 98.5% to 99% accurate, according to Euroimmun/Perkin Elmer.
The test is available at GetQuestTest.com. Results are available one to two days on average after providing a blood draw. Individuals will have the opportunity to speak with a licensed physician about their results and whether or not they have been exposed to COVID-19 and have developed antibodies.
Cost is $119.00 plus $10.30 a service fee. After purchasing the service, an individual will be prompted to schedule an appointment for a blood draw at one of the Quest patient service centers.
