Title : Tarrant County reports 3 more coronavirus deaths, but new cases trending downward
Ariticle : 
Tarrant County reported three more coronavirus deaths and 61 new cases on Wednesday.
Among the deaths were two Fort Worth women in their 30s and 90s, and a Grapevine woman in her 70s. All three had underlying health conditions. Tarrant County has confirmed 61 pandemic-related deaths, including 35 in Fort Worth, six in Arlington and three in Grapevine.
The county has confirmed 2,149 COVID-19 cases, including 61 deaths and 387 patient recoveries.
Tarrant County Public Health reports cases after it receives the test results. The county reported 69 new cases on Tuesday and 72 on Monday after several days of new case counts over 100.
Some signs point to a possible downward trend in new cases. Since last week, new cases have decreased each day when evaluated by specimen collection date. The new cases reported by specimen collection date since Friday have been 53, 20, 12, 9, and 3 on Tuesday, although the chart notes that some of the most recent data may not have been reported yet and some tests may still be pending. The epidemic curve by specimen collection date data is generally a day behind the current case total.
"These deaths are grim reminders of the seriousness of this pandemic," Tarrant County Public Health Director Vinny Taneja said in a news release. "Our sympathy goes out to their families."
Taneja urged residents to stay home, if possible, despite Gov. Greg Abbott's reopening orders that go into effect on Friday.
There are 2,585 available hospital beds (of 5,817 total) in the county and 3,232 occupied, including 205 by confirmed COVID-19 patients. The county has 468 available mechanical ventilators; 209 are currently in use.
