Once these 275 devices have been delivered, the central administration will have distributed a total of 1,011 respirators since the disease was first registered in the country on March 3.
BUENOS AIRES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Argentinean government began on Saturday the distribution of 275 mechanical ventilators throughout the country to reinforce the health system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Once these 275 devices have been delivered, the central administration will have distributed a total of 1,011 respirators since the disease was first registered in the country on March 3, government sources told Xinhua.
The operation began on Saturday at El Palomar Airport in Greater Buenos Aires, where an aircraft from the Argentinean Air Force (FAA) took off with 68 respirators and other health supplies for distribution in the provinces of Cordoba, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman, Formosa, Salta, Misiones, Corrientes, Jujuy, Chaco, La Rioja, and Catamarca.
"It is a coordinated effort between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defense. We are part of that gear that is responsible for the distribution of critical supplies. It is a sign of the need for us, as Argentineans, to stand side by side," said FAA Commodore Ricardo Cappabianca, head of the El Palomar Air Brigade.
The task will continue next week, when the remaining 207 respirators will be distributed to the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Mendoza, Rio Negro, Neuquen, Entre Rios, Santa Cruz, Chubut, La Pampa, San Juan, San Luis, and Tierra del Fuego, and the capital of Buenos Aires.
As only a few companies in the country are able to produce ventilators, the government made the decision to regulate and centralize the machines' distribution based on the needs of each province, the Ministry of Health told Xinhua.
Argentina reported 4,532 cases of COVID-19, with 229 deaths, as of Saturday morning.
