In the evening, the hospital said the outbreak was related to the patient who was diagnosed with the coronavirus over the weekend . The patient’s parents and a member of the patient’s clinical team have since tested positive.
According to the hospital, everyone who has been exposed or suspected to have been exposed has been notified.
“All patients on the affected unit have tested negative for COVID-19. Staff on the unit continue to be tested. SickKids and Toronto Public Health are actively investigating how the virus was transmitted,” said SickKids in a statement.
Additionally, on Tuesday morning, SickKids identified a second patient who was admitted and tested positive for COVID-19.
