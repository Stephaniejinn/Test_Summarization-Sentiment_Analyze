Title : Botswana: Ddt College of Medicine Donates to Frontline Workers
Ariticle : 
Gaborone â€” DDT College of Medicine has donated sanitisers to the COVID-19 Relief Fund.
Receiving the donation, director of the national disaster management office, Mr Moagi Baleseng thanked the college for finding it fit to donate to frontline workers such as health workers, Botswana Police Service, Botswana Defence Force and Botswana Prisons Services.
He said the sanitisers would help recipients in their fight against coronavirus.
Mr Baleseng urged Batswana to continue washing hands with soap or sanitisers, staying at home and practicing social distancing.
Vice chancellor of the college, Dr Tumelo Tlhoiwe said their graduates manufactured the sanitisers.
She said they struggled to procure ethanol to make effective sanitisers, and that the graduates ended up making their own ethanol.
She said they had donated to Bamalete Lutheran Hospital and found it prudent to donate to frontline workers who were fighting the pandemic on behalf of the nation.
