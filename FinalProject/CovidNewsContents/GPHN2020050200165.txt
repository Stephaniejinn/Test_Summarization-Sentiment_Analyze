Florida, which had its first case confirmed on March 1, will enter the First Phase of the Three established for the "reopening" on Monday.
Three counties in the southeastern state (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach), where the main focus is, will not yet be incorporated into the process back to normal, which begins after a month in which Florida has been under a confinement order that included the closure of all businesses deemed non-essential.
Of the 34,728 cases confirmed since March 1, more than 20,000 are in those three counties.

The number of hospitalizations statewide reached 5,589 and tests reached 384,153, of which 8.8% were positive.
PHASED REOPENING
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Friday that next Monday will also open state parks, something he was considering doing in Phase Three.
"Today I am announcing as part of Phase One that, starting Monday, May 4, Florida's world-renowned state park system will open," he said during a press conference in Jacksonville, northeast Florida.
"I think we've seen enough about COVID-19, I think science supports it, that outdoor transmission is less likely than transmission in a closed environment," the governor added.
On the other hand, the DeSantis working group published in recent hours its recommended final guidelines for the state to reopen.
The aim is to return to normal in an "intelligent, safe and step-by-step way" and to maintain as a priority the protection of the most vulnerable, elderly and chronically ill, fundamentally.
In Phase One, most measures to restrict economic activity will be relaxed, but the obligation of the physical estrangement of six feet (1.82 meters) between people and the prohibition of gathering more than ten people will be maintained.
Except for cinemas, bars, gyms, hairdressers and other personal service establishments, all businesses will be able to open their doors in Florida from May 4, although some will have to operate with certain restrictions.
Hospitals and medical centres will also be allowed to re-perform normal procedures and operations, which was prohibited in order to have full capacity to deal with the pandemic and will increase the capacity to perform COVID-19 tests throughout the state.
Phase Two recommends avoiding meetings of 50 people or more, but allows employees to return to work step-by-step.
Also,bars, clubs and sports attractions operate at 50% capacity and for restaurants, gyms and retailers to operate at 75% capacity.
Non-essential travel will also resume in the Phase Two recommendations.
THE FINAL STEP DEPENDS ON THE NUMBERS
If the number of COVID-19 cases in the state continues to decrease during Phase Two, the working group recommends moving to Phase Three.
In the latter, employers can summon all their employees back, with telework being seen as an option for vulnerable populations, according to the report.
Personal service companies, such as salons and hairdressers, can operate at full capacity in this Final Phase, in accordance with the recommendations.
All non-essential travel can be resumed in Phase Three, but people must comply with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding isolation after the trip, the document detailed.
