Abstract

Given the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus and the lack of proven specific therapeutic drugs and licensed vaccines effective against it, early diagnosis of the disease is of paramount importance. The common chest CT imaging of confirmed COVID-19 cases is discussed here, which shows ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, and consolidation.
