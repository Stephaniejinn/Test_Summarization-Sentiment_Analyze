Title : Namibia: Coronavirus Briefs - Schools to Reopen On 3 August
Ariticle : 
SCHOOLS around the country are expected to reopen on 3 August for pupils to return to face-to-face education.
Education executive director Sanet Steenkamp made the announcement on Friday, adding schools are expected to open in Stage 3 of the state of emergency that was announced by president Hage Geingob. According to Steenkamp, all schools should follow guidelines to ensure the safety of children, teachers and staff members. Steenkamp said all staff members of the ministry, including teachers, hostel staff and cleaners, are expected to report for duty between today and 11 May. The government has in the meantime allowed schools to conduct classes through online platforms, but the system has received criticism as it does not cater for all pupils.
Geingob praises media in Covid-19 fight
PRESIDENT Hage Geingob has applauded journalists as frontline workers for putting their lives at risk to ensure valuable information reaches the public. In his message on World Press Freedom Day on Sunday, Geingob said this year's celebrations took place in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes journalists and reporters deserving of collective praise for ensuring information is shared with the public. Namibia will continue to champion press freedom through the promotion of a pluralistic and independent press in line with the principles of the 1991 Windhoek Declaration, he said. The 1991 Windhoek Declaration, from which World Press Freedom Day was born, is a statement of press freedom principles adopted at the Unesco seminar held in Windhoek in 1991.The 2020 World Press Freedom Day was celebrated under the theme 'Journalism Without Fear or Favour'.
