Title : Minister Provides Update On Contact Tracing
Ariticle : 
Minister of Health Kim Wilson confirmed during yesterday evening’s [April 29] press briefing that focus is being placed not only on testing for Covid-19, but also on contact tracing when positive cases have been identified.
Speaking at the press briefing, Minister Wilson said, “As I have mentioned previously, testing is just one measure which we use to stop the spread of COVID-19. Another very important mitigation measure is contact tracing.
“Therefore, we have steadily increased our capacity for contact tracing. Staff from various other areas in government have been enlisted to assist in this regard and we now have six groups of five contact tracers.
“Further, we are looking to train some additional essential workers in contact tracing.
“It is important to remember that a negative test result tells you your status at a specific point in time. It doesn’t mean that you are immune, it doesn’t meant to stop washing hands or wearing a mask.
“It means that right now you don’t have an infection, but you still have to take all the precautionary measures to ensure you don’t contract it in the future.“
