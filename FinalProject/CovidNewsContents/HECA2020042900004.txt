Ariticle : 
April 28, 2020 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada
The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, spoke with David Parker, New Zealand’s Minister for Trade and Export Growth, yesterday evening, April 27, 2020.
Minister Parker expressed New Zealand’s sincere condolences regarding the national tragedy in Nova Scotia, which reminded him of the horrific attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year.
Minister Ng commended Minister Parker on New Zealand’s management of COVID-19, which has led to positive developments on the road to reopening his country’s economy. The ministers discussed specific challenges that must be addressed during the pandemic, including the importance of supporting the most vulnerable people and small businesses in need of help. Minister Ng spoke about how this will play a large role in Canada’s approach to economic recovery.
Regarding international trade, Minister Parker noted New Zealand’s appreciation for Canada’s leadership on COVID-19 at the World Trade Organization (WTO) – including the Canada-led joint statement on April 22, 2020, committing to open and predictable trade for agriculture and agri-food so that Canadians and people worldwide can have access to essential food and agricultural products.
The ministers also discussed opportunities to build on their existing collaboration, including through the Ottawa Group, which works on WTO reform, to keep trade flowing and global supply chains open to ensure stability and predictability for our citizens and businesses in this uncertain time.
