No new cases detected in the community

According to the Ministry of Health, from 18:00 on 28/4 to 6h on 29/4: Vietnam has no new cases of Covid-19. Up to 6am on 29/4: Vietnam has a total of 130 cases of entry quarantined immediately.


Statistics on isolation numbers: The total number of people in close contact and entry from the epidemic area being monitored for health (isolation): 42,057, of which:

- Centralized isolation at the hospital: 323.

- Isolation concentrated in other establishments: 6,643.

- Isolating at home and place of residence: 35,091.

Regarding the anti-epidemic situation, according to the report of the National Steering Committee for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19, BN151 was positive for SARS-CoV-2: The patient was BN207&#39;s wife.

The patient was also announced to be cured and with her husband discharged from the hospital, continued to be isolated and monitored at home for another 14 days as prescribed by the Ministry of Health. However, on April 27, after the husband&#39;s positive BN207 returned, BN151 was also taken to isolation at Cu Chi field hospital (Ho Chi Minh City).

Also on April 27, she was tested and gave negative results. On 28/4, the second test and the result returned positive. Currently patients are being monitored and treated at Cu Chi field hospital.

The Ministry of Health also informed that there are currently 11 cases with one-time negative result of SARS-CoV-2; 8 cases with test results 2 or more times negative for virus.

Cases of re-positive Covid-19: Virus did not develop through culture

Previously, the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology said that it had received 3 specimens of Covid-19 re-positive cases of the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 2 samples of Quang Ninh but had just conducted virus culture on 3 form. The virus culture time is one week. Initial results show that this virus did not grow.
Prof. Dr. Le Quynh Mai, Deputy Director of the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology said the virus did not develop because the virus was weak, unable to multiply, not enough concentration to infect cells, amplify them. .

Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long posed 3 possibilities with some negative cases to be positive during treatment.

Firstly, it is possible that the patient has not fully recovered, during the treatment process, they have not eliminated all pathogens, the virus still exists in the body, especially in the lung mucosa cells.

The second is the possibility that these people have recovered from the disease but in the process of eliminating the virus in the form of inactivated virus. When we amplify genes, we identify the genes of the virus. In this case, the pathogen excreted but the pathogen did not work.

The third is the healthy carrier, as the Deputy Prime Minister said we have a case. Up to now, we have not confirmed for sure whether a healthy person has the same carrier but it is in such form. This can happen when the human body has not produced enough antibodies to be able to control, control and destroy this virus.
