Title : 6 more Lancaster cases, state total tops 6,000
Ariticle : 
COLUMBIA - With 350 new confirmed cases of coronavirus announced Wednesday and Thursday, state health officials say 6,095 cases have been reported in South Carolina since the outbreak began here March 6.
Three new positive cases were announced in Lancaster County on Wednesday and three were announced Thursday, bringing its total to 96.
There are 25 active cases in Lancaster County that fall within a 14-day window, said Darren Player, director of Lancaster County Emergency Management.
"It's holding pretty steady, thank goodness," Player said.
Eleven more deaths were announced Wednesday statewide, and 12 more were announced Thursday.
Along with 29 additional deaths that the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control reported Wednesday, there have now been 244 COVID-19 fatalities in the state in the past 46 days.
In a Wednesday news release, DHEC said those 29 additional deaths occurred from March 25 to April 21 and were not accurately reported by local and state officials who certify deaths.
The agency said state health officials were unaware of the previously unreported deaths until data was cross-checked.
DHEC is notified of deaths by a handful of medical personnel, including doctors and nurse practitioners. Some deaths are also reported by county coroners, who investigate deaths that don't happen in hospitals.
Of the unreported 29 coronavirus deaths, nine were in Greenville County and eight were in Richland County.
Greenville has had a total of 34 coronavirus-related fatalities and Richland has had 33.
"As our state continues to respond to this unprecedented event, DHEC remains committed to ensuring that every South Carolinian who has died from COVID-19 is counted," said Dr. Brannon Traxler, an agency physician.
"This action aligns with efforts currently under way by other states and will assist us in more fully understanding the burden of this disease across the state and those populations who are most severely affected."
Four of the state's 244 total deaths have been in Lancaster County, which now has reported 96 positive cases since the pandemic started in early March.
DHEC is also tracking recovery rates and reported earlier this week that 76% of those who have tested positive in the state have recovered from the virus.
