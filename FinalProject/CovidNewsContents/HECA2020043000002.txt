The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, and Danielle McCann, Quebec’s Minister of Health and Social Services, announced that the governments of Canada and Quebec have reached an agreement to make additional funding of over $21.4 million available through the Reaching Home program for 2020–2021. This funding will enable us to continue our shared efforts to prevent the impact of COVID-19 on people experiencing homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. All Quebec regions that are already receiving Reaching Home funding will have access to additional funds.
These funds include:
The Canada–Quebec Agreement to support the homelessness sector’s response to COVID-19 under Reaching Home builds on the collaborative terms and principles established in previous agreements on homelessness and will be based on Quebec’s service organization structures.
In addition to this funding, which will be disbursed over the coming days, an additional $2.2 million has already been granted to Montreal as part of the Reaching Home program, through the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et des services sociaux (CIUSSS) du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. This is part of an additional $15 million in funding to support communities across the country that have had to deal with needs in the early weeks of the pandemic.
Communities will also benefit from the program’s flexibility to reallocate their existing Reaching Home funds to support their response to the COVID‑19 pandemic.
Nationally, the Government of Canada will set aside a portion of the $157.5 million in funding previously announced by the Prime Minister to ensure the possibility of reinvesting in specific communities that are dealing with a larger COVID-19 outbreak.
