Abstract

The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at December 2019 had led to a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the disease started to spread all over the world and became an international public health issue. The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances. Alongside the various discussion, our suggested solution for certain situational issues is also presented.
