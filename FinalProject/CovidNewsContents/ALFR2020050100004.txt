Title : Botswana: Contact Tracing Commences in Mookane
Ariticle : 
Mahalapye â€” Contact tracing has started in Mookane, where someone who tested positive for COVID-19 had contact with a villager.
Mahalapye District Health Management Team (DHMT) public relations officer, Ms Pauline Bontle explained that the village did not have any confirmed COVID-19 cases, and that the village was included because there was a contact in Mookane, who had been in contact with a person, who tested positive for COVID-19.
She said the DHMT had managed to trace the contact and that he/she was quarantined with the family in one of the lodges. "We took swabs and the results came out negative," she added.
As a precautionary measure, Ms Bontle said the Ministry of Health and Wellness engaged ACHAP to conduct contact tracing and target testing on everyone who could have come into contact with the Mookane contact.
The COVID-19 response task team has changed its approach from random community testing to contact tracing and target testing in a bid to to catch up with the rapid spreading deadly virus.
