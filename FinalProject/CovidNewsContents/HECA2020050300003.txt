Ariticle : 
May 2, 2020 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada
The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, today issued the following statement:
“In these times of uncertainty, it is more important than ever that we keep global supply chains open so that goods and services can continue to be delivered to the people and places that need them.
“On April 30, following a virtual meeting with my counterparts from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, we signed on to a 
joint statement
 supporting concrete actions to advance the commitments agreed upon by the G20 trade and investment ministers on March 30, 2020.
“We agreed to facilitate the cross-border movement of essential goods and to maintain open and connected supply chains throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes expediting customs procedures; facilitating the timely flow of essential goods, whether it be by air, sea or land freight; and not imposing export restrictions or implementing unjustified trade barriers in a manner inconsistent with WTO rules.
“Canada continues to play a leadership role on the world stage to ensure that essential goods and services are available and accessible to Canadians and people around the world—and to ensure Canadian companies and workers can continue to do business in the global marketplace.
“At this critical time, international cooperation is crucial as we work towards an economic recovery plan that prioritizes the health and safety of our people, and minimizes the economic impacts of COVID-19 – leaving no one behind.”
