Title : Official says US missed chances to slow coronavirus: Live updates
Ariticle : 
Confirmed global infections stand at almost 3.4 million, with some 239,000 deaths and almost 1.08 million recoveries.
Here are the latest updates:
The Japan Sumo Association has announced that it will reconsider its schedule for the summer grand tournament starting on May 24 if the government extends the state of emergency, Japan's NHK news reported. 
The nationwide measure is currently due to expire on Wednesday, May 6.
The association already announced in April it would postpone the opening of the summer event for two weeks to May 24, due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Organisers are also considering holding the tournament without spectators, or canceling it, the report said.
South Korea reported six more cases of the new coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the nation's total infections to 10,780, according to Yonhap news agency.
It marked the fourth day in a row for the new daily infections to stay in the single digits.
The nation's death toll from the virus rose by two to 250, while 9,123 people have recovered, up 51 from a day earlier.
An investigation conducted by the Reuters news agency has revealed that taxpayers' money have gone to some companies and people facing civil or criminal fraud investigations in the US.
The disclosures about such payments have prompted outrage among some congressional Democrats, who say they highlight the problems with how stimulus funds have been distributed.
The funds came from the $2.3tr CARES Act passed by Congress to blunt the economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 64,000 Americans and thrown at least 30 million people out of work.
Gilead Science Inc's antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the US.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with US President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday that the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a national viral genomics consortium to better sequence the transmission of the deadly disease also known as COVID-19.
