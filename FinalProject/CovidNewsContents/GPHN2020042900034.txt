Fraser Health says 25 workers at a Coquitlam poultry plant have tested positive for COVID-19 to date.
In a statement, the health authority provided an update on the ongoing outbreak at Coquitlam’s Superior Poultry Processors Ltd. , noting that 236 of the facility’s employees and 73 close contacts have been tested to date.
The outbreak at Superior Poultry was confirmed by Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry last week . The plant has since been shut down.
Superior Poultry is the sister facility to the  United Poultry plant in Vancouver , where 35 cases have been confirmed so far.
Fraser Health says “case and contact management is ongoing” at the Coquitlam plant.
New cases at long-term care facilities
Fraser Health also confirmed two new cases of COVID-19 at long-term care facilities Valhaven Home and MSA Manor in Abbotsford.
One resident at Valhaven Home and a staff member at MSA Manor were diagnosed with the virus, and they are both in isolation.
“To prevent transmission of COVID-19, Fraser Health is ensuring staff currently working at Valhaven Home and MSA Manor will not be working at any other facility,” said the health authority.
In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak at the Langley Lodge long-term care facility has been declared over.
“Fraser Health has implemented comprehensive strategies to prevent and respond to COVID-19 in long-term care, assisted living and independent living facilities, and there are no longer any COVID-19 cases at this site,” stated the health authority.
Dr. Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix will provide an update on BC’s latest COVID-19 case count Monday afternoon at 3 pm.
