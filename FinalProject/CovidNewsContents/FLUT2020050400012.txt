Abstract

Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 start to get increasingly described [1-3]. However, the link of causality remains uncertain. Reports of chilblains-like lesions circulate on social medias and have appeared in the literature [4,5]. Google Trends (GT) provides data on the relative search volumes (RSV) of queries and topics over time and across geographical areas (
https://trends.google.com/trends/
). It allows seasonal and long-term assessment of trends in public interest, including during COVID-19 outbreak [6,7]. We investigated whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to acral eruption during the COVID-19 epidemic in France.
