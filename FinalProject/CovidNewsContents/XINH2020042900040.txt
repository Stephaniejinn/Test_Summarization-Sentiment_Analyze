SYDNEY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Aussies flocked to the water on Tuesday as the iconic Bondi Beach reopened for surfers and swimmers after being closed due to COVID-19.
For around one month, locals and visitors have been banned from the beach entirely after evidence emerged of thousands of people on the sand ignoring social distancing rules.
Coming as a relief to many, as of Tuesday surfers and swimmers were allowed to enter the water between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. local time from designated points - however the sand itself remained closed.
Waverley Council Mayor Paula Masselos stressed that the policy was strictly to "Swim & Go" and "Surf & Go" with fines potentially being issued for those lingering unnecessarily.
