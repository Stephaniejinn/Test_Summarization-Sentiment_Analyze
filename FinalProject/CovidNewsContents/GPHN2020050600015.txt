Title : GLOBAL ROUND-UP
Ariticle : 
? Australia's booziest state is planning to impose strict time limits for drinkers when its pubs reopen this month. Bars, restaurants and cafes in the Northern Territory have been asked to prepare safety plans ahead of the easing of lockdown measures on May 15, with alcohol only allowed with food and customers not able to stay longer than two hours. Australia's "Top End" has the highest rate of alcohol consumption per capita of any state or territory.
. ? China reported one new case of coronavirus and no deaths, marking three weeks since it recorded a Covid-19 fatality. The National Health Commission said 395 people remained under treatment in hospital, while 949 were under isolation and observation for suspected cases or after testing positive despite showing no symptoms.
? Indigenous leaders in Brazil asked the World Health Organisation to set up an emergency fund to help protect their communities from the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of Brazil's 850,000 indigenous people live in remote Amazon areas with little access to healthcare, and indigenous groups say the government of president Jair Bolsonaro has not included the communities in national plans to fight the virus.
. ? The pandemic has brought back something unseen in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution: a drive-in cinema. Once decried by revolutionaries for giving unmarried young couples too much privacy, a drive-in cinema now operates from a car park under Tehran's Milad tower. Workers spray disinfectants on cars that line up after customers buy tickets online.
