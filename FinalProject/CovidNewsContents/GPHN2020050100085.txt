On Monday, the Ontario government released a plan, with a series of stages, for gradually reopening the economy, which Premier Doug Ford called a “roadmap,” not a “calendar,” as it did not include any dates for the phases.
The province has completed 277,522 tests so far for the virus. This is up 12,928 tests from the previous day. The Ontario government said it had a target of 14,000 daily tests by the end of April.

“They fell short just by 1,000,” Ford said at his daily briefing on Thursday. “Believe me I was all over it this morning, they absolutely promised it’s going to be over 14,000 tomorrow and moving forward.”

“But we don’t want to just stop at 14,000, we want to continue to expand these tests to our absolute maximum,” Ford continued.
“I’ll tell you one thing, I’m like a dog on a bone on this. I will not let go for a second, and every single day as I’ve been held accountable, we are all going to be held accountable and the health team as well.”

The ministry also indicated there are 2,614 confirmed cases among long-term care residents and 1,430 cases among staff.
Ontario officials have said there may be a discrepancy between overall deaths and deaths at long-term care homes due to how the province’s health database system, called iPHIS, is tracking data and how the Ministry of Long-Term Care is tracking data.
