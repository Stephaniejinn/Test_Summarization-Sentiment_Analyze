While it may be challenging to precisely predict the spread of COVID-19, “what we can control is our planning, preparedness and our ability to remain ready for whatever may come our way,” said Army Col. (Dr.) Andrew Barr, director of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), during his weekly Facebook town hall April 8.
During the town hall, he explained what measures the medical center has implemented to keep beneficiaries and staff safe, and also how WRNMMC service members have deployed to help battle the novel coronavirus. 
For patient and staff safety, WRNMMC started restricted access control points March 12, decreasing the medical center’s exterior entrance points to monitor and screen people for COVID-19. Corpsmen and medics monitor the entrances, asking questions regarding each individual’s possible exposure to COVID-19 to ensure staff and patients are symptom-free before entering WRNMMC, or assisting symptomatic individuals with donning an appropriate mask and escorting them to the centralized screening area tent, located outside of the emergency department, for further evaluation, explained Army Master Sgt. Rich Ciuk, chief of both WRNMMC’s Incident Management Team Operation and the Operational Management Department.
“This is an ever-evolving process we’re working to make sure we have the best practices,” said Ciuk. “We keep force-health protection and the safety and security of everyone in mind.”
