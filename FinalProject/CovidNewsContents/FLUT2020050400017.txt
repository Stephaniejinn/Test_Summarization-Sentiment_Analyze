Abstract

Cutaneous manifestation has been reported in 0.2% of patients infected by COVID-19 in China, and 18 out of 88 patients from Italy. The most commonly reported features are exanthomatous rash, urticaria, chickenpox like vesicles, petechiae, and acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy. Herein, we report one case of pityriasis rosea in a patient infected with COVID-19.
