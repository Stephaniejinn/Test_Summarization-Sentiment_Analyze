Title : US records 1,453 new COVID-19 deaths in 24 hours
Ariticle : 
Washington, May 3 (Petra) -- The United States reported 1,453 new COVID-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of virus-related mortalities to 6622, according to data released by the Johns Hopkins University on Sunday.
The Baltimore-based university has recorded more than 1.1 million confirmed cases from the novel coronavirus in the country so far.
Although the number of coronavirus-related deaths remains high, the US is gradually lifting its quarantine procedures, where around 35 states are expected to ease their strict isolation measures, while the US Food and Drug Administration has allowed to use the experimental drug "Remdesivir" urgently, saying it helps in the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
