Title : Leading epidemiologist in the United States: Pandemic will not stop until 60-70% of the US population is infected
Ariticle : 

TTO - Leading American epidemiologists predict that the COVID-19 epidemic will last for at least 18-24 months, until 60-70% of the population is infected and cured; The vaccine may help but it won&#39;t be soon.

In an independent report published April 30 (US time), a team of experts, including Mike Osterholm - an adviser to many US presidents, is now director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and University Policy. Minnesota (CIDRAP), Professor Marc Lipsitch - epidemiologist at Harvard University, Dr. Kristine Moore - former US CDC official, and historian John Barry - disease expert, published 3 future scenarios for the University Translate COVID-19 as follows:
Scenario 1:
The current wave of infection (ie, the spring in the northern hemisphere) will continue with smaller waves throughout the coming summer. It will stay like that for 1-2 years, gradually disappearing at some point in 2021.
Scenario 2:
The current wave of infection will be followed by another larger wave in the fall or winter, then one or more smaller waves in 2021.
&quot;This scenario requires reapplication of isolation measures in the fall to prevent the health system from overloading. It is quite similar to what happened during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic,&quot; the report described.
Scenario 3:
The infection will gradually decrease but at a very slow rate. &quot;This scenario does not require re-application of quarantine measures, although the number of infections and deaths continues to rise.&quot;
The expert group recommends that governments prepare for scenario 2, the worst case scenario.
&quot;The vaccine can help control the epidemic, but it will not be available until at least 2021. We still do not know what difficulties will arise in the research process, which may take longer than expected. &quot;, evaluation report.

&quot;This disease will not stop until it infects 60-70% of the population. The idea that everything will end soon goes against the theory of microbiology,&quot; said Osterholm, research leader. , commented on CNN.
The group&#39;s forecast differs from the computational models of groups such as the Institute of Health Measurement and Evaluation (IHME, Washington University) or Imperial College London (UK), which predicts millions of deaths in the United States.
CIDRAP is based on medical reports on COVID-19, actual statistics, and historical data on past pandemics ... to produce the three scenarios mentioned above.
&quot;Because of the long incubation period, the likelihood of asymptomatic infection, the high R0 index, COVID-19 spreads more easily than seasonal flu. The higher the R0, the more people are infected and immune before the epidemic can become end.
Based on the latest influenza pandemics, this pandemic is likely to last 18-24 months, &quot;said Prof
Marc Lipsitch added.

TTO - According to current regulations, 28 days after the patient is infected in an isolated community, no longer able to spread will be able to declare the end of the epidemic. It has been 23 days now.
