About 27 million Americans do not have health insurance and a ventilator will cost 72,000 U.S. dollars each, Volodin said.
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. healthcare system does not correspond to the democracy the country preaches, chairman of the Russian State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin said on Tuesday, commenting on COVID-19 fatalities in the United States.
About 27 million Americans do not have health insurance and a ventilator will cost 72,000 U.S. dollars each, but the U.S. government only plans to give each 1,000 dollars in emergency aid, according to his speech during a video conference of the State Duma.
"Therefore, there are such a large number of deaths, because they do not have the opportunity to use medicine, because they do not have medical insurance," he said.
