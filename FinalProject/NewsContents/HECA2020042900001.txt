The Government of Canada is taking strong, immediate, and effective action to protect Canadians and businesses from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Today, Minister Fortier continued to meet virtually with business associations across Canada. She participated in a digital town hall with the Greater Sudbury Chamber of Commerce, the fourth such outreach event in the last month.
Minister Fortier and two northern Ontario members of Parliament, Paul Lefebvre of the riding of Sudbury and Marc Serré of Nickel Belt, discussed challenges facing the region’s businesses and how the Government of Canada is delivering support through its 
COVID-19 Economic Response Plan
.
Some of the key measures in the Plan, which address the needs of Canadians and businesses during this time of global uncertainty, include:
The Government of Canada is also working with provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary top-up to the salaries of essential workers that provinces and territories have deemed essential in the fight against COVID-19.
The government continues to assess and respond to the impacts of COVID-19. It stands ready to take additional actions as needed to stabilize the economy and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.
