Title : Two new COVID-19 cases reported in region
Ariticle : 
Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee each reported a new confirmed COVID-19 case Friday.
According to the Virginia Department of Health (www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus) and Tennessee Department of Health (www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov), Lee County, Virginia, and Washington County, Tennessee, rose to 10 and 55 cases respectively in reporting Friday.
Lee County's 10 cases and one death since the pandemic began put the LENOWISCO Health District at 41 cases and two deaths. Wise County remained at 22 cases and one death for a third day, while Scott County stayed at seven cases and one death. Norton remained at two cases.
Hawkins County remained at 30 cases and two deaths, while Sullivan County stayed at 49 cases and one death.
In Tennessee, the total of state residents tested in the pandemic climbed by 8,506 to 186,132 Friday, or 2.7% of the state's populace. Hawkins County saw 842 of 56,786 residents tested, or 1.48%. Sullivan County's total tested stood at 1,398 of 158,348, or 0.88%. In Washington County, 1,719 of 129,375 people were tested, or 1.33%.
The VDH website on Friday did not provide numbers of COVID-19 tests by health district. Statewide, 105,648 people were tested out of 8.63 million state residents, or 1.22%. The total of state cases increased 1,055 to 16,901 Friday, while deaths increased by 29 to 581.
Virginia Department of Health officials said Friday the more than 1,000-case increase was due partly to improved state testing capacity. Dr. Karen Remley, chair of Gov. Ralph Northam's COVID-19 testing work group, said that the daily testing capacity has grown from 2,000 tests more than a week ago to more than 5,000 a day on Wednesday and approximately 5,800 tests Thursday.
Remley said that the state's daily testing capacity has made it possible for doctors and hospitals to start testing anyone who thinks they may have COVID-19 symptoms. She said anyone who thinks they need to be tested can now go online to find testing sites by zip code at www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/covid-19-testing-sites/.
