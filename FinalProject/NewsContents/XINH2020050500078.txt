The total number of deaths in Spain rose to 25,613 after 185 people died of COVID-19 in the 24-hour period until 21:00 Monday local time. 
This is 21 more than the 164 deaths registered both on Sunday and Monday, but means the daily death toll has remained below 200 for three consecutive days.
MADRID, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Services on Tuesday confirmed rises in the numbers of new deaths and cases of the coronavirus.
The total number of deaths in Spain rose to 25,613 after 185 people died of COVID-19 in the 24-hour period until 21:00 Monday local time (1900 GMT). This is 21 more than the 164 deaths registered both on Sunday and Monday, but means the daily death toll has remained below 200 for three consecutive days.

There was also a rise in the number of new cases of COVID-19 detected by PCR tests (which discovers if the coronavirus is active in the body), with the Health Ministry confirming 867 new infections, some 500 more than 24 hours earlier. But both the increases in new cases and deaths are partly attributed to delays in collecting data over the weekend.
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain now stands at 219,329.
