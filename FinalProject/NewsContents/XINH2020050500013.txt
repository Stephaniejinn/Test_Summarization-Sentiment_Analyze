MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu watched a Victory Day air parade rehearsal near the Red Square, the TASS news agency reported Monday.
According to the report, 75 airplanes and helicopters took part in the rehearsal, including MiG-31K fighters capable of carrying hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, fifth-generation Su-57 fighters, A-50 long-range reconnaissance aircraft, Il-76 transport aircraft, Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers, as well as Mi-8 and Mi-28N helicopters.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has postponed all public events to mark the 75th anniversary of the World War II victory, including a major military parade on the Red Square, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, Putin said that the air parade will be held on May 9.
Last year, the Russian Defense Ministry canceled an annual air parade in Moscow due to bad weather.
