(TAP) - The equipment of a COVID-19 testing laboratory have been set up on Tuesday at the regional hospital Sadok Mokaddem in Djerba (Medenine governorate), as part of reinforcing the capacity of screening for coronavirus and bringing services closer to the citizen.
Hospital Director Salem Aissa said the laboratory will be operational in the next two days, with the finalisation of the equipment set-up and the staff training process launched on Tuesday.
Works are ongoing at the hospital for the establishment of a COVID-19 ward, which will be operational as soon as possible, he added.
This project was launched at the initiative of the association of architects and funded by the Djerba Foundation Sustainable Development, with an amount exceeding 1 million dinars, between construction and equipment.
The COVID-19 ward will be used as a medical intensive care unit, after the end of the pandemic.
