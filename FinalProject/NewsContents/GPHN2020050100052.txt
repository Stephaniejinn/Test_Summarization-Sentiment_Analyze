Title : South Dakota reports 4 COVID-19 deaths, 76 new cases
Ariticle : 
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) â€” South Dakota health officials on Thursday reported four deaths from COVID-19 and an additional 76 new cases.
All the deaths came from Minnehaha County, which has had most of the infections in the state. Many have come from an outbreak at a Smithfield pork processing plant that infected 853 employees.
State epidemiologist Josh Clayton said he does not expect that infections of Smithfield employees will increase because the plant has been closed for two weeks. Two Smithfield employees have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, contributing to a total of 17 people who have died statewide.
A total of 2,449 people have confirmed cases across the state. The actual number of COVID-19 infections is thought to be far higher than the number of confirmed because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
