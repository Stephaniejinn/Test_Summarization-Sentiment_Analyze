Title : Bloomberg: Coronavirus pandemic likely to last two years, report says
Ariticle : 
The coronavirus pandemic is likely to last as long as two years and won`t be controlled until about two-thirds of the world`s population is immune, a group of experts said in a report.
Because of its ability to spread from people who don`t appear to be ill, the virus may be harder to control than influenza, the cause of most pandemics in recent history, according to the report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. People may actually be at their most infectious before symptoms appear, according to the report, Bloomberg wrote.
After locking down billions of people around the world to minimize its spread through countries, governments are now cautiously allowing businesses and public places to reopen. Yet the coronavirus pandemic is likely to continue in waves that could last beyond 2022, the authors said.
As UNIAN reported earlier, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world exceeded 3.2 million patients as of the morning of May 1.
