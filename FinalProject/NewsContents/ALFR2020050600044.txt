Title : Botswana: Mixed Reactions Over Food Parcels
Ariticle : 
Molepolole â€” As the distribution of food parcels to households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continues across the country, the process has sparked mixed reactions among residents at Lephaleng Ward in Molepolole.
In an interview with BOPA, some residents were unhappy that the food parcels they received were without toiletries and some staples such as samp.
They also argued that some suppliers distributed items of low quality.
However, residents commended government for looking out for them during these trying times.
A resident, Mr Baboloki Seboneng thanked government for assisting his family with food.
He said although it took long for help to come their way, the items they received were better than no food at all.
Meanwhile, Molepolole Lentsweletau Administration Authority, Lentsweletau senior council secretary Mr Gofaone Kgabanyane explained that quantities varied according to the number of household members.
He stated that items not included in the packages were registered and would be distributed to beneficiaries as soon as they were available.
He however, expressed concern over individuals who were not honest with officials during assessment.
