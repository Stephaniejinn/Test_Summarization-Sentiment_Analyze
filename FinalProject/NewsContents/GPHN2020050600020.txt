Travelers returning from overseas should notify health officials before returning and stay at quarantine hotels if they live with persons with chronic disease, the elderly or children
PublishTime：2020-05-02
On May 2, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced that beginning 00:00 Taipei Standard Time on May 4, inbound travelers returning from overseas should complete the COVID-19 Health Declaration and Home Quarantine Notice and confirm if their residence satisfies the home quarantine requirements before boarding.
Such inbound travelers should stay at a quarantine hotel after entry if they live with people 65 years old or older, children 6 years old or under, or persons with chronic diseases
 (such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or lung diseases) 
or if they don’t have a separate room (including a separate bathroom). The new measure is to be implemented to prevent an infected traveler developing symptoms during home quarantine from infecting his or her family members living together. Those who make a false health declaration will be fined up to NT$150,000.
