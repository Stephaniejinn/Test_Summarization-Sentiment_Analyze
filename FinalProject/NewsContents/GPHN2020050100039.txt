B.C. has 21 active COVID-19 outbreaks at seniors' care homes or assisted living facilities and three more at acute care facilities, thanks to a new outbreak at Surrey's Residence at Clayton Heights within the past 24 hours, provincial health officer Bonnie Henry told media April 29. There is also a renewed outbreak at Langley's Langley Lodge.
