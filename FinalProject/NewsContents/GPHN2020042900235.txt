Coronavirus outbreak: Canadaâ€™s top doctor says education on vaccine important ahead of potential COVID-19 treatment
Asked about concerns of a potential anti-vaccination movement in Canada once one a vaccine has been created for COVID-19, Canada's chief medical officer Dr. Theresa Tam stressed health authorities will need to ensure proper education continues to be put out about the safety of vaccines, not only in terms of a COVID-19 treatment but all vaccines. She added that as COVID-19 measures scale back, having people take vaccinations can help reduce the chance of outbreaks of the novel coronavirus or other diseases.
