Title : In China they use exoskeletons to increase delivery capacity
Ariticle : 
MEXICO CITY, May 4.- The coronavirus outbreak has increased the demand for dealers of all kinds, especially those who bring food to homes, as a measure to maintain social estrangement and prevent the spread of coronavirus.
As a result, Chinese delivery men began using exoskeletons, in order to triple their cargo capacity. Thanks to these robotic suits, Hummingbird, China's online food delivery platform, Eleme's instant delivery arm, equipped its employees with a system that allows to increase the capacity to distribute orders and orders of a dealer.
According to a video from the cntech post portal, it is possible to see a dealer equipped with an exoskeleton, which allows him to carry up to three cargo backpacks, which is three times a load higher than that of an average dealer.
Eleme is a Chinese company known for using various technological tools that have allowed it to optimize the order delivery process and two years ago integrated the delivery of orders through the use of drones.
Thus, the company decided to integrate the exoskeleton developed by the firm ULS Robotics of Shanghai, China, in order to develop a system that allows its dealers to increase the load capacity up to 50 kilos.
It should be noted that the exoskeleton delivery service is still under testing, however, in the future this technological tool could be implemented to optimize the order delivery process.
