Title : Pandemic reaches more than 500 in Tamaulipas
Ariticle : 
Tamaulipas has already overd 500 cases of coronavirus and two bowls have just died from this cause. The pandemic is advancing; however, many people remain unaware of the seriousness of the case as yesterday not only broke quarantine, but also omitted healthy distance measures and the use of mouth-coverings. The bad news is that this irresponsibility drags us all.
Last night in a statement, the Ministry of Health confirmed 34 new positive cases to covid-19, to give a sum of 516 confirmed and 23 deaths. It is striking that only 63 patients have recovered, 12 percent.
Victoria remains the city with the highest number of cases, with 115, but it is clear that the area with the greatest impact at the moment is the south of Tamaulipas, because of its conurbado character.
Tampico already has 90 confirmed patients, Madero 70 and Altamira 17, which gives a sum of 177 cases in the south of the state.
As for the deaths, the area accumulates four, two of them were reported last night, male 56 and 87 years old.
If with all this data, there are still people who don't believe in the disease, I don't know what they need to do it.
At the border of the state, Matamoros was for several weeks the municipality with the most cases, until being displaced by the capital. Today the land of Rigo Tovar has 103 sick people, but it carries the deadliest statistic with seven deaths.
Nuevo Laredo, in turn, accounts for 49 positive cases and three deaths. The least impacted is Reynosa, as he has only 35 sick people and three deaths.
Victoria also has three deaths, Xicoténcatl one, Rio Bravo una, Mante una, Madero one (Tampico three).
The pandemic is present in 15 of the 43 municipalities of the state territory, some are small populations and far from the urban spot but that is where the damn virus came.
For example, Camargo with a case, Gonzalez one, Goémez dos, Tula dos, Xicotécatl eight. The Ministry of Health urges tamaulipecos to stay at home, as the following days will be essential to slow down the rate of contagion, make hygiene measures extremely and protect older adults, as the older age increases the likelihood of complications and lethality.
