The Government of Canada is working closely with partners to ensure Canadians have access to the supplies they need to stay safe and healthy in response to COVID-19.
The Honourable Anita Anand, Minister of Public Services and Procurement, announced today the creation of the  COVID-19 Supply Council which will bring together a diverse group of leaders to provide the government with advice on the procurement of critical goods and services required as part of Canada’s COVID-19 response and recovery.
The Council will provide advice on building innovative and agile supply chains for goods in wide use such as masks, gloves and disinfectants, including production, sourcing, shipping and distribution strategies as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve.
This partnership with the private and non-profit sectors complements Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19. As part of these efforts, Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Government of Canada’s central purchaser, has finalized agreements in Canada and around the world in order to provide healthcare workers with the equipment they need to protect themselves and care for Canadians.
