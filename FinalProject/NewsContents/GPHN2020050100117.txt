Popular Ottawa beer-maker, Big Rig Brewery has started to make a new product amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to help stop the spread of the virus. 
The brewery has announced that as of Tuesday, they have begun producing small quantities of hand sanitizer, which they have been donating to those in need.
Recently, Big Rig has donated a quantity of the new sanitizer to Shepherds of Good Hope. 
Lon Ladell, Big Rig Brewery owner, thinks it's important to donate to the shelter.
"I wanted to reach out to them and make sure the hand sanitizer was getting into the hands that really needed it," Ladell explained.
Ladell adds that the brewery plans to continue donating the sanitizer to those who need it.
Big Rig is also offering the hand sanitizer for sale on its website for $13.95.
