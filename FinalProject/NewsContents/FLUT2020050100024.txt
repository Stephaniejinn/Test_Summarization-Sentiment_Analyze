							Half of Moscow’s coronavirus patients in serious condition have tested negative for the virus, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin 
said
 Thursday amid questions over the accuracy of Russia’s tests.

His revelation follows a 
directive
 for Russian doctors to diagnose Covid-19 without tests after a widely reported study placed their accuracy at around 70%. Moscow’s health department reportedly 
warned
 the city’s clinics in April that many coronavirus tests return false negative results.
