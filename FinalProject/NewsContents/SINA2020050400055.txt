Original title: The study found that patients with fever did not have new coronavirus antibody experts.
[Overseas Network May 4 | Wartime Epidemic Time Zone] Comprehensive Kyodo News, TBS TV and other media reported on the 4th that the research team of the Central Civic Hospital in Kobe City Medical Center, Japan announced on the 2nd that after testing blood of 1,000 patients It was found that about 3% had antibodies that showed that they had been infected with the new coronavirus, which did not include patients in emergency treatment and fever clinics. In this regard, the Japanese Aichi Medical University Hospital doctor Goto Rei speculated that the actual number of new coronary pneumonia infections in Tokyo may be &quot;20 to 25 times&quot; of the number of currently diagnosed infections (4568), that is, about 100,000 people .
According to reports, the Kobe City research team said that 33 of the 1,000 people who came to the clinic detected IgG antibodies formed after a period of infection, and the test did not include patients in emergency treatment and hot clinics. It is reported that calculations based on the gender and age distribution of the entire Kobe city show that before the release of the emergency declaration on April 7, approximately 4.7% of approximately 41,000 people had been infected with the new crown virus. At that time, the actual number of infected people may be hundreds of times the number of patients in Kobe City through PCR detection.
The director of the hospital, Kashiki Kuroki, pointed out: &quot;The results show that a considerable number of people may be infected, and the new coronavirus test (PCR) alone cannot grasp the actual situation.&quot; He believes that if the proportion of the number of infected people can be grasped through antibody testing, it can be used as a basis for judging whether to relax the restrictions on going out and activities.
For this result, Goto believes that &quot;because there are more people in the city center and more mobility, there will be more asymptomatic infections.&quot; He also predicted that the actual infected people in Tokyo should be 20 to 25 times the number of people diagnosed.
In addition, the program also introduced some cases of asymptomatic infections, including &quot;no pneumonia at all, fever not exceeding 37.5 degrees, (related) symptoms did not last more than 1 week&quot;, and stated that &quot;this should be a widespread situation&quot; .
According to the latest statistics from the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), as of the 4th local time, 15082 cases of new coronary pneumonia have been diagnosed in Japan and 538 deaths. Among them, 4568 people have been diagnosed in Tokyo, which is the most among all parts of Japan. (Overseas Network Wu Qian)
