The BOCOG held live-stream interviews with more than 400 candidates from around the world on Wednesday after it launched campus recruitment on December 17 last year and more than 5000 people signed up.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the BOCOG gave up holding a centralized written test after the Spring Festival and screened the job applicants through online evaluation, resume screening and comprehensive evaluations instead.
