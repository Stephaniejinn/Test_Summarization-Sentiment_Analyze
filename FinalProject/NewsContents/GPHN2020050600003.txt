Four staff members at the Civic Campus emergency department have tested positive for the Novel Coronavirus. 
The Ottawa Hospital and Ottawa Public Health have now declared an outbreak at that facility.
The hospital has taken additional precautions
 like expanding staff lounge areas to enhance physical distancing, increasing its cleaning frequency in the emergency department and staff lounge areas, and ensuring that everyone who enters the area is wearing personal protective equipment at all times to reduce the spread of the virus and to protect patients as well as staff. 
Hospital officials say the emergency room is safe to visit. Anyone in need of emergency medical care should still go to the hospital.
