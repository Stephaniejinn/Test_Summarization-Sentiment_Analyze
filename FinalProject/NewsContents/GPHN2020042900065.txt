Production is scheduled to start from May 2020 at Denka's Omi Plant (Itoigawa, Niigata Prefecture). Denka regards measures to combat coronavirus infections as part of its social responsibility and is working to swiftly build its production systems to ensure reliable supply. Avigan is an anti-flu medicine developed by FUJIFILM Toyama Chemical Co Ltd that shows promise as an effective treatment for COVID-19.
 COVID-19 is a disease for which there is currently no established treatment, and in response to its rapid spread around the world, it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 Mar 2020. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the early discovery and development of effective treatments. The Japanese government is proceeding with domestic pharmaceutical approval of Avigan. On this occasion, the government expressed its wish to use raw materials made in Japan to establish a consistent domestic supply structure, and in response to the request, Denka made the decision to supply diethyl malonate.
