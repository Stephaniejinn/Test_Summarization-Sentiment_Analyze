DUBLIN, April 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- ResearchAndMarkets.com published a new article on the pharmaceuticals industry, "Single Vitamins Experience Growth of 166% Amid Coronavirus Pandemic"
With the outbreak of COVID-19, sales of high dose vitamin C supplements have soared. Vitamin C has long been seen as important for the immune system and many consumers are looking to give their immunity a boost at this time. The lockdown has also created huge demand for vitamin D supplements.
This vitamin is typically absorbed from sunlight and as the public have been encouraged to spend more time indoors, some are worried about the effect on their vitamin D levels. Many consumers are turning to supplements as a result. Sales of children's single and multivitamins are also growing rapidly as consumers try to protect their families from the effects of COVID-19. Companies like Pharmavite, Pfizer, Bayer and Santa Cruz Nutritionals have seen increased demand for their vitamin supplements.
