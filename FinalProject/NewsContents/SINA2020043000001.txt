Three days before this week, &quot;Newscast&quot; was unusual. This block of China ’s most influential TV news program has broadcast five blockbuster comments in a row:
On April 27, &quot;International Review: Pompeo Spreading&quot; Political Viruses &quot;Is Turning Himself into a Human Enemy&quot;
On April 28, &quot;International Sharp Review: Bears&quot; Four Deadly Sins &quot;&quot;, &quot;Xinhua Times Review: Pompeo&#39;s Absurd Logic Contains Distress&quot;
On April 29, &quot;People&#39;s Daily Bell Article: How long will such a poor performance last?&quot; &quot;,&quot; International Sharp Review: How many American politicians eager to &quot;scratch the pot&quot; want to hide the truth of the epidemic? 》
Of the five articles, the protagonist of four of them is US Secretary of State Pompeo. Three of the four articles directly clicked on the name &quot;Pompeo&quot;.
This arrangement is quite rare, and the comments are very strict.
Provoke alienation, manipulate right and wrong, and constantly trample on the bottom line of human morality
Never seen a secretary of state like Pompeo in the history of the United States, whose actions have broken through the bottom line of being a man
Since it became a stumbling block for the unity of all humans to fight against epidemics, it has become an accomplice in the spread of the virus
Overdrawing US diplomatic credibility and harming global anti-epidemic cooperation has become a huge shame and misfortune for the United States
In the impression of Zheng Zhi (WeChat ID: upolitics), this is the first time he has seen &quot;Newscast&quot; blame a high-ranking American official for many days in a row.
why? There are answers in five reviews.
&quot;Four Deadly Sins&quot;
As of 9 o&#39;clock on April 29th, Beijing time, a total of 1029878 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia were diagnosed in the United States, with a total of 58640 deaths. Compared with the total number in the world, the number of confirmed diagnoses in one country in the United States is close to one-third of the number of confirmed diagnoses in the world.
There is no doubt that the current situation of pneumonia in the United States is very serious.
However, since the outbreak, Pompeo, as the chief diplomat of the United States, has done nothing in the prevention and control of the outbreak, just like an &quot;invisible man.&quot; On the contrary, he jumped the most fiercely in pouring dirty water to China.
&quot;News Broadcast&quot; summarized Pompeo&#39;s &quot;four sins&quot; in the international sharp commentary on the 28th:
First of all, Pompeo promoted the &quot;cut off supply&quot; of WHO, and it is harmful to the global epidemic, especially to the least developed countries and vulnerable groups.
Secondly, in order to cover up the failure of the US government to respond to the epidemic, Pompeo continued to &quot;dump the pot&quot; in China, deliberately provoke hatred and opposition, and repeatedly undermine the international epidemic prevention efforts;
Third, the epidemic has already caused trauma to all mankind, but under the impetus of Pompeo, the US government continues to exert &quot;extreme pressure&quot; on countries such as Iran and Cuba, causing a greater humanitarian disaster;
Fourth, Pompeo stood idly by in the prevention and control of domestic outbreaks in the United States, and ignored the lives of the American people and pursued private political interests.
Spill dirty water to China
Focusing on the crime of splashing dirty water in China, Pompeo&#39;s &quot;dirty water&quot; mainly focuses on two aspects.
The first is the origin of the virus.
Although the WHO has repeatedly stated that it is necessary to avoid the use of the name “Wuhan virus”, which may incite racial discrimination, and the Chinese side emphasized that the origin of the virus is a scientific issue, it needs to listen to science and respect the opinions of the scientific profession. Pompeo still has many The new crown virus was called &quot;Wuhan virus&quot; on public occasions.
In an interview on April 15, he not only claimed that the virus originated in Wuhan, China, but also &quot;explicitly&quot; that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute was only a few miles away from that seafood market.
The second is the &quot;China Responsibility Theory.&quot;
On March 24, in an interview with a &quot;Washington Watch&quot; radio program, Pompeo accused China of being opaque in responding to the epidemic and did not alert the United States and share intelligence with the United States as soon as possible.
Recently, Pompeo has also mastered the &quot;skills&quot; of making crimes in a &quot;necessary&quot; way.
On April 22, Pompeo said that the wild animal wet goods market &quot;may be&quot; an important factor leading to the spread of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, and called on China and other countries to permanently close these markets; The Chinese government &quot;possibly&quot; grasped the first batch of cases as early as November last year.
Of course, these words plus &quot;possible&quot; are also groundless.
China does not have a &quot;wild animal wet goods market&quot;, and from January 3, it will regularly and proactively report the epidemic information to WHO and relevant countries and regions, including the United States. Video conferences have also been held to share prevention and control experience.
As Xinhua Times commented, behind the &quot;American-style pan&quot; is that the US authorities are doing everything possible to find excuses and scapegoats to cover up their own problems. No matter how hard it is, the pan can&#39;t beat the Pacific.
More importantly, a recent autopsy report published in Santa Clara County, California, USA, showed that the earliest death of new coronary pneumonia occurred on February 6, which was three weeks earlier than the first death case announced by the US Centers for Disease Control.
The international sharp commentary broadcast on &quot;Newscast&quot; on the 29th pointed directly to the evidence that the US government deliberately concealed the early warning of the epidemic.
Will be in office for two years
Pompeo&#39;s fourth sin is &quot;pursuing political self-interest.&quot;
Where does the profit come from?
Yang Xiyu, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, pointed out in an interview with the Global Times that a characteristic of current US politics is that rhetoric about China is becoming a catch for political games. This year&#39;s US elections have begun, and some anti-Chinese politicians will naturally clamor to compete with China.
From Pompeio&#39;s perspective, the day after tomorrow is a special day.
On May 2, 2018, Pompeo officially took the oath of office as the new Secretary of State. Today, his term is about to expire for two years.
When he first took office, Pompeo was called a &quot;diplomatic amateur&quot; because he had no diplomatic experience. From 2017 until he became Secretary of State, he was the head of the US CIA and the only politician in the history of the United States to serve continuously as the head of the CIA and Secretary of State.
After two years as Secretary of State, Pompeo&#39;s international diplomatic performance seems to be not satisfactory to many parties.
In April 2019, two months after the second &quot;Super King Meeting&quot;, the head of the US Department of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Quan Zhenggen, publicly declared that the DPRK was dissatisfied with the main representative of the US denuclearization negotiations, Secretary of State Pompeo, and hoped that Participate in the negotiation with someone who is “more cautious and mature in communication”.
In May 2019, Pompeo went to Finland to participate in the ministerial meeting of the &quot;Arctic Council&quot;. Because the United States refused to mention climate change, the meeting failed to issue a joint declaration as usual. That was the first time since the establishment of the Arctic Council in 1996 that it failed to issue a joint declaration at the end of the ministerial meeting.
At the Foreign Ministers ’Meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) on March 25 this year, Pompeo tried to write the&quot; Wuhan virus &quot;in the joint statement, but was met with opposition from the foreign ministers of other countries and led to the final abortion of the joint statement.
As for China, in the past two years, no matter where it is, &quot;words must call China&quot; seems to have become a practice of the &quot;Chief American Diplomat.&quot; His various remarks about China are, in the words of Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, &quot;the world is spreading rumors and slanders and instigating the flames.&quot;
The International Sharp Review of &quot;Newscast&quot; said this:
If Pompeo stands alone and continues to put political self-interest above public interests, then he will be abandoned by the American people and will remain infamous in the history of American diplomacy.
