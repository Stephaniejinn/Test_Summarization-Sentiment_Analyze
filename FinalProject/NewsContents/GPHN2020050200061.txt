Title : 10 in Warm Springs test positive for coronavirus; no known link to feast
Ariticle : 
May 01--The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which reported their first coronavirus cases last week, now say 10 people on the reservation have tested positive. The figure is up from four last Friday and two on April 21 -- the day the tribes’ first cases were announced. No one from the reservation has died or been hospitalized because of the virus, and 41 cases remain pending. The tribes last week warned those who attended a mid-April feast in Celilo Village they may have been exposed to COVID-19. But Louie Pitt Jr., the tribes’ director of government affairs and planning, said that as far as he knows, the positive cases aren’t connected to the feast. Bobby Begay, a Yakama tribal member and Celilo Village leader, died a week ago from complications related to COVID-19, according to the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. He was deeply involved in tribal culture and the fishing community and was a lead fish technician for the commission.
 Over 100 people statewide have succumbed to the illness. Confirmed cases have topped 2,500. -- Jim Ryan; jryan@oregonian.com; 503-221-8005; @Jimryan015 Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.
