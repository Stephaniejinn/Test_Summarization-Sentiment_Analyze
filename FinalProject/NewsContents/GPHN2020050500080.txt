VANCOUVER --   The province's health officer says 53 more people tested positive for COVID-19, and three more people have died since the last B.C. update.
Speaking from Victoria Monday afternoon, Dr. Bonnie Henry said 34 test-positive cases were reported between Saturday – the date of her last public update – and Sunday afternoon.
Another 19 tested positive within the last 24 hours, she said during a news conference that also included the latest modelling data.
Henry did not say when the deaths occurred, but said all three were at long-term care homes. A total of 117 people have died of novel coronavirus so far this year.
When it comes to people the province considers "fully recovered," the number has climbed to 1,417.
Where are the cases?
The total number of people who've been diagnosed in the province so far is now 2,224.
Nearly half of those people (1,027) have been in the Fraser Health region, which spans Burnaby to Boston Bar.
Another 845 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, followed by 177 in Interior Health, 124 in Island Health and 51 in Northern Health.
Currently there are 77 patients in B.C. who are in hospital, 20 of whom are in critical care.
Henry said B.C. is currently dealing with 23 active outbreaks in long-term care and assisted living facilities and acute care units. Fortunately, no new outbreaks have been reported in the last two days.
But, Henry said, there have been additional cases. Thirteen were reported in acute, assisted living and long-term care facilities, bringing the total to 266 residents and 168 staff.
Referring to B.C.'s outbreaks at several poultry processing plants, Henry said the total number of test-positive cases associated with the plants has risen to 96.
Another 134 people have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus in connection with the outbreak at a federal penitentiary in Mission, B.C. Henry said 13 of those patients are staff members, while the remainder are inmates.
Oilsands outbreak tied to health-care worker's case
Henry spent much of her previous update outlining an outbreak associated with an oilsands project near Fort McMurray, Alta.
On Monday, she said 15 people from the Kearl Lake project have tested positive in B.C., and some of their family members appear to have the virus as well.
"This is one of the reasons we have been so concerned," Henry said.
"We have asked anybody who's returning from working at the Kearl Lake plant while the outbreak continues there…we do here in B.C. require people to self-isolate whilst they're here, and that is because we know that people who have been in an outbreak situation are at a higher risk of developing this illness during the incubation period."
She said she knows outbreak measures are in place, but there's still a risk. Until the outbreak is over, isolation is a requirement, and family members are asked to self-monitor.
Henry used one case to illustrate the risk: a worker came back and didn't realize they had a mild form of the virus. They passed it on to a close contact, who is a health-care worker.
"So we need to be very vigilant right now," she said.
