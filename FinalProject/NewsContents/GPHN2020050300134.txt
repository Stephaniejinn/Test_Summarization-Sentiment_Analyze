Without no regard to social distancing, the residents of Tappita in their hundreds stormed the 36-bedroom hotel rented by the government for the keeping of suspected cases, broke into it and released those quarantined and came out jubilating with palm thatches.
Nimba County has six confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The health authorities are yet to comment on the incident.
