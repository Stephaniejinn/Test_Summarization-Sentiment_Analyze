Abstract


This preliminary report hypothesized that immune systemâ€™s response to infections in the lung may play a role in 25(OH)D levels of elderly patients infected with COVID-19. We performed a retrospective study in two tertiary medical centers in South Asia.

The medical records of COVID-19 patients were reviewed and a total of 176 subjects included were the elderly whose age is at least 60 years, with information in age, body mass index (BMI), sex, comorbidities, pre-hospital 25(OH)D level, and clinical characteristics. We reported that majority of the subjects had 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/ml, most of them were male, had diabetes, and were classified as severe. Most of the male and female subjects had 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/ml. Also, most of the subjects with pre-existing condition had 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/ml. Majority of subjects classified as severe had 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/ml. Age and 25(OH)D level were negatively related.

Although clinical trials could provide more meaningful findings as to the causation of 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 severity, basic healthy solutions such as Vitamin D supplementation could be raised even in the community level and awareness on Vitamin D benefits in fighting infections, such as COVID-19, should be disseminated especially to the vulnerable elderly population.
