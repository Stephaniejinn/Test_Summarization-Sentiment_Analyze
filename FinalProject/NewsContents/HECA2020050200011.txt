Title : Statement by Minister Bardish Chagger marking Jewish Heritage Month
Ariticle : 
GATINEAU, May 1, 2020
This May marks the third annual Jewish Heritage Month, a time to celebrate Jewish culture, faith, and history in Canada.
Canada is home to the fourth-largest Jewish community in the world. Though this May will be different, due to COVID-19, we can still celebrate the important contributions Jewish Canadians have made to Canadaâ€™s social, economic, political, and cultural fabric while recognizing their courage and strength throughout history.
As Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, I believe that a strong society is inclusive and diverse. Canadians must stand together against antisemitism and discrimination in all its forms, whether it occurs online, at work, or in our communities.
On behalf of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Government of Canada, I invite all Canadians to learn more about the history and accomplishments of Jewish Canadians through stories from our past, present and future.
