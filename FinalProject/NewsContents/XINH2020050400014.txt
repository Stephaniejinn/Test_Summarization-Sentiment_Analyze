CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's total confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 126,045, while the infection cases in Iran hit 97,424. Both countries, the hardest-hit countries in the Middle East, witness continued slowdown in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Turkey's total confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 126,045, with 1,670 new patients reported in the last 24 hours, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Sunday.
The death toll from the novel coronavirus in Turkey reached 3,397 after 61 more lost their lives over the past 24 hours, Koca tweeted.
A total of 63,151 patients have recovered, the minister said.
"For the first time today, the number of healed patients has exceeded our current number of coronavirus patients since March 11," Koca stated.
The number of new cases and the daily death figures have been in decline in Turkey nearly in the past two weeks.
The infection of 976 people with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours took Iran's tally to 97,424, according to Iran's Health Ministry on Sunday.

The number of fatalities in the country mounted to 6,203 after 47 died overnight, the ministry said.
It also said the rate of infections and the number of death cases have started a "gradual" downward trend.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that the mosques will reopen in 132 towns designated as low-risk areas on Monday, as the COVID-19 infection cases and the death toll have taken on a downward trend over the past weeks.
Rouhani said that Friday prayers will also resume in those areas with respect to the health protocols.
The number of coronavirus cases in Israel has risen to 16,193 with eight new cases, the state's Ministry of Health said Sunday.
According to the ministry, the number of new recoveries was more than five times higher than the number of new patients, with 41 patients recovered since Saturday evening.
This raised the total number of recoveries to 9,634, while the number of active cases dropped to 6,329, the lowest figure since April 1.
The number of death cases increased from 229 to 231.
On Sunday, some of the schools in Israel were reopened for first through third grade classes, as well as 11th and 12th grade classes.

The Israeli Ministry of Education said that schooling had resumed in 80 percent of cities and towns.
However, major cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa and Beer Sheva, have postponed the opening of schools to implement hygiene and distance restrictions imposed by the government. 
Meanwhile, Israeli researchers have developed a method to predict coronavirus outbreaks by testing sewage systems, Ben-Gurion University (BGU) said Sunday.
In a study by BGU, in collaboration with Israel's Ministry of Health, the researchers developed a tool to warn of COVID-19 outbreaks, on the basis of molecular tests of neighborhoods and cities' sewage systems.
The researchers said the presence of the virus in wastewater indicates infection in the area, and as the number of viruses increases, more people are infected.
They noted that the virus appears in wastewater before the onset of coronavirus symptoms in patients, helping to provide efficient alerts.
In Saudi Arabia, 1,552 new coronavirus cases were reported on Sunday, raising the total cases to 27,011. It also reported 8 new deaths to bring the total fatalities to 184.
