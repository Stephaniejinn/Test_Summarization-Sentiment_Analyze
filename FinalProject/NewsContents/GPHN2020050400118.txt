Contrary to the seasonal flu in which millions of people are caught each year, the coronavirus epidemic, which creates a much larger panic environment, is more dangerous than the flu? Today we will explain to you why the coronavirus is more dangerous than seasonal flu in 4 items.
Why is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has become the main agenda of the world since the end of 2019, is causing so much fear? The COVID-19 epidemic, which has been repeatedly stated to be less lethal than the influenza epidemic almost every year, does it really kill less?
In the news in CNN International, 4 reasons were taken to take large-scale measures against the COVID-19 outbreak based on the information received from the experts. Today we will explain to you in 4 items why coronavirus is a more terrible epidemic than a normal flu epidemic. If you’re ready, let’s start:
Coronavirus is more contagious
A person who gets the flu infects an average of 1.28 people. In coronavirus, this rate can be between 2 and 3 or even up to 30, according to the statement. This allows the coronavirus to spread much faster.
Coronavirus takes life faster
The COVID-19 virus takes on much faster life than Influenza. According to data published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 331 people died daily between October 2019 and April 2020 due to flu. On the other hand, coronavirus caused an average of 739 people to die in the USA between 6 February and 30 April.
Coronavirus symptoms show later
One of the main reasons why coronavirus is more contagious is that it shows its symptoms much later. A person suffering from a normal flu pandemic begins to show symptoms from one to four days. Normally this number does not exceed 2 days. In COVID-19, this number can be extended up to 14 days while the minimum is 4-5 days. The person who feels healthy because he has no symptoms transmits the virus to more people.
There is a vaccine for the flu but not for the coronavirus
There are many different vaccines for the flu epidemic that we have been used to living together for many years. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus. This allows the epidemic to spread much faster.
