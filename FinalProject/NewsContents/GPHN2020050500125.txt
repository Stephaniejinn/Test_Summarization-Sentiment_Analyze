Title : COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 News from Preprints; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activation: a novel potential Covid-19 therapeutic strategy (Published April 5, 2020)

2020 MAY 1 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Drug Week -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Drug Week - According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:
“Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) downregulates pulmonary ACE2 protein, resulting in pneumonia. Thus, increasing ACE2 activation may serve to both neutralize the virus and rescue cellular ACE2 activity protecting the lung from damage. Diminazene, an ACE2 activator, is suggested to be a novel tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.”
