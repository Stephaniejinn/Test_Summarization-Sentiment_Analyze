Abstract

The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. It has been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and the whole world is suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, no treatment for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon. This review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent clinical trials carried out in this field.
