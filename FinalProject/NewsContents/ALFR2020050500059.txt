Title : Angola: COVID-19 - Recovery Rate Above Average
Ariticle : 
Luanda â€” The recovery rate of those infected with Covid-19 in Angola is around 31.4 percent, exceeding the rate established by the World Health Organization (WHO), considered the secretary of State for Public Health, Franco Mufinda.
Speaking to ANGOP last Sunday, on the sidelines of the briefing for updating epidemiological data, the official explained that this international organization estimates it at 26% for each country, judging by the number of positive cases confirmed so far (35).
Of this total, Angola has 11 recovered, 22 active cases and two dead, indicators that, according to Franco Mufinda, "prove that the country is on the right path, as it is a gain for the country, and constitutes an important indicator for the recovery of the largest part of the diseased".
According to the secretary of State for Public Health, the gross mortality/death rate in the country is around 5.7%, in reference to the last 24 hours.
In this regard, he compared Angola with some neighbouring countries in the southern region of the continent, specifically Congo Brazzaville (229 confirmed cases, of which ten died), with a 10.9% recovery rate and 3.9% mortality rate.
Observing the reality of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), he said that DRC recorded 604 cases and 32 deaths (11.1% recovered and 4.8% mortality), Namibia, 16 cases (without deaths) and a 50% recovery rate, against zero mortality.
Zambia (109 cases, three deaths) has 62.9% recovered and 2.4% mortality, while South Africa remains the most affected country, with 6,333 cases and 123 deaths, representing 37.5% recovery and 1.9% mortality.
Overall, in the last 24 hours, the global recovery rate was around 31.1%, while the mortality rate was 7.12%.
