Four more COVID-19 cases have been confirmed by public health officials in Sarnia-Lambton, but the percentage of overall positive tests has dropped to eight.
A total of 187 of the 2,407 tests – nearly 300 more than Friday – have come back positive. Ninety-six people have recovered and 14 have died, but none since April 20.
There continues to be three institutional outbreaks at seniors’ homes. Thirty Landmark Village residents and 10 staff have tested positive and six of the region’s deaths are linked to the Sarnia retirement home. Vision Nursing Home has four residents and two employees who’ve contracted the virus and Sumac Lodge is also in outbreak status after one staff member tested positive, health officials said. Both facilities are long-term care homes in Sarnia.
None of those numbers have changed in the last couple of days.
Lambton Meadowview Villa, a long-term care facility near Petrolia where one worker tested positive, had an outbreak that was declared over by public health officials after one week in late April.
Bluewater Health reported Saturday nine patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were being treated at the hospital, the same number as the previous day. Another 15 patients with suspected cases were waiting for test results, three less than Friday.
