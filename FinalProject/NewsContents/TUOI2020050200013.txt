, the initial clinical condition is fever, dyspnea and body aches, which is true of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19.
According to Mr. Nguyen Khac Hien - Director of Hanoi Department of Health,
patients from Nghe An hometown, who have just come from Hanoi and have a fever should be examined first and then transferred to Duc Giang General Hospital, because patients with breathing difficulties should be transferred to Hanoi Heart Hospital. Testing by quick test at Hanoi Heart Hospital gave positive results on 1-5.
Immediately after the quick test result, the patient was transferred to the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases for isolation and treatment, 11 people who have close contact with the patient were kept waiting for the Realtime PCR test result. of the patient.
However, Mr. Hien affirmed that there is no isolation for 600 people in the patient working and living area (in Kieu Ky, Gia Lam) as online information.
A few minutes ago, the PCR test result at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases revealed that the patient was negative for SARS-CoV-2 virus.
