Hu, who leads the Chinese delegation to China-France High-Level Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), said that since the beginning of this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron have spoken by phone for three times and reached important consensus on jointly dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and developing China-France relations.

It is hoped that the two sides will further strengthen cooperation in trade, investment and other fields, as well as under the framework of the Group of Twenty, to create an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, Hu said.
For his part, Le Maire, who also serves as the leader of the French delegation to the economic and financial dialogue, expressed gratitude for China's support and assistance, saying that the French side is willing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields, including anti-epidemic, energy, agriculture and customs clearance, through such channels as the China-France High-Level EFD to push for new development in France-China relations.
