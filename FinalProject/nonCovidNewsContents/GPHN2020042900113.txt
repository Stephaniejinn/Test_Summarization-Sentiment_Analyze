Title : ‘African Swine Fever’ affecting pigs in Assam might have come from China
Ariticle : 
Assam: Assam Agriculture Minister Atul Bora suspected that a lot of pigs in the state could be suffering from ‘African Swine Fever’ and that the infection might have crossed over from China or Tibet into Assam. “It has also been reported in China. In Arunachal, it began. After the pigs died in that state, the corpses were dumped in the rivers from where the infection has probably come to Assam”, Bora told media. More than 2000 pigs have died from the disease. He said that the disease is highly contagious and could be carried by humans. However, this flu cannot affect humans, he added.
