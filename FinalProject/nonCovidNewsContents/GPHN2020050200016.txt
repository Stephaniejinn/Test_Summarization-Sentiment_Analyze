Title : UN agency alarmed as pandemic blocks shipments of standard vaccines
Ariticle : 
Vienna (dpa) - The disruption of air traffic amid the coronavirus pandemic has created a massive backlog of vaccine shipments that could result in outbreaks of preventable diseases, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned on Friday.
For the past two weeks, the UN agency has seen planned shipments drop by between 70 and 80 per cent.
In addition, freight rates have jumped 100 to 200 per cent above normal levels as many commercial aircraft are grounded and cargo carriers are struggling to meet demand.
More than two dozen countries in Africa and Asia are at an especially high risk of running out of vaccine stocks because they are difficult to reach, UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told an online press briefing from Geneva.
This includes Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Nepal, all of which experienced measles outbreaks last year.
"Children's lives are at stake," said Mercado.
Last year, her organization procured 2.43 billion vaccine doses for 100 countries, to immunize approximately 45 per cent of all children below the age of five against diseases such as measles and polio.
Governments, corporations and air carriers should free up affordable freight capacities to overcome the supply chain disruption, Mercado said.
