Original title: Zhong Nanshan specifically mentioned that there is sufficient evidence to prove that Lianhua Qingwen is effective
At 20 o&#39;clock on May 4, Beijing time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Health and Welfare Committee jointly invited Zhong Nanshan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, to answer the &quot;epidemic&quot; question for international students.
Zhong Nanshan reminded foreign students that if they have a little fever, they should drink plenty of water and take some medicines taken in the past, such as Baifuling and ibuprofen. These are all effective, or they can be used to clear the plague.
He specifically mentioned that we have just finished an experiment and will soon publish it. For the first time in the world, there is sufficient evidence to prove that Lianhua Qingwen is effective and helps patients recover.
