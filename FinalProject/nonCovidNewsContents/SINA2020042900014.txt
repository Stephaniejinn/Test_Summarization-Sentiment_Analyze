Title : Bill Gates speaks for China&#39;s righteousness
Ariticle : 
Original title: Sharp Reference | He who speaks for China ’s righteousness, is now being madly &quot;siegeed&quot; in the United States
When &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is rampant, it takes courage to tell the truth.
In this sense, Bill Gates, co-chairman of the American Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is a courageous person.
Since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, Gates has repeatedly used practical actions to help the world fight the epidemic, and has carried out a number of cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions.
When a politician in the United States tried to provoke public opinion and &quot;dump the pot&quot; to China, Gates also stood up many times and made a statement for China&#39;s righteousness.
However, his &quot;contrary ears&#39; loyalty&quot; has now encountered some people&#39;s crazy siege in the United States, which is shocking.
　　
On April 26, Gates was interviewed by CNN because he talked about China and received much attention.
When the moderator mentioned that &quot;someone accused China of covering up the truth during the epidemic and should be held responsible&quot;, and asked Gates&#39;s views on this, Gates responded that it is &quot;untimely&quot; to discuss this topic, which is a global effort to fight the epidemic. interference.
He pointed out that China has done a lot of right things since the beginning of the epidemic. In contrast, the United States was originally thought to be a good response to the epidemic, but the result is now very poor.
For those who accused China of motives for speech, Gates was also outspoken, saying that this was to divert attention, which contained a lot of unfair and wrong accusations against China.
On the same day, in an interview with the Financial Times, Gates also responded to questions about China. When someone accused China of not being open to the outside world in dealing with the epidemic, he said: &quot;Most people, whenever something new happens , They have consistently criticized that country, just repeating these criticisms. But we should discuss the matter on this issue. I do n’t see any deep insights into the origin of the disease, and think that someone is hiding something. &quot;
&quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that Gates was &quot;impatient&quot; for such accusations of China, and he also expected that he would incur &quot;a lot of criticism&quot; for showing up during the new crown epidemic.
&quot;It&#39;s strange, it&#39;s all terrible.&quot; He said at the end of the interview.
　　
In fact, Gates&#39;s worries are not unfounded. Just one day before he was interviewed by CNN and the Financial Times, people in Texas held a gathering event and shouted the slogan &quot;Arrest Bill Gates.&quot;
Why is Gates hated by these people? Things have to start from 5 years ago.
In a speech in 2015, Gates warned that if anything could kill tens of millions of people in the next few decades, it would not be a missile, but a deadly microorganism.
He pointed out at that time that mankind was not prepared for the next outbreak, and said that if we act now, then before the next plague comes, mankind will still have the opportunity to be fully prepared.
Now that the New Crown epidemic has suddenly struck, Gates ’speech was overturned five years ago. Some people marveled at Gates ’s far-sightedness, but some people threw out a&quot; conspiracy theory. &quot;
Some people in the United States claimed that it was Gates who made the new corona virus and tried to profit from it, so he was so concerned about the epidemic. Gates&#39; vigorous promotion of vaccine research and development has also been criticized by some people who oppose vaccination.
&quot;New York Times&quot; statistics show that Gates has become the favorite target of rumors, from February to April, on TV and social media, the gates and the new crown virus link appeared 1.2 million times. In the past two months, 10 videos spreading rumors involving Gates on the video site &quot;Ubbit&quot; have been viewed nearly 5 million times.
&quot;Because of the conflict with the Trump administration on the virus issue, Bill Gates became the target of right-wing attacks.&quot; The New York Times broke the reason behind Gates&#39; &quot;siege&quot;. The article pointed out that Gates has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration for no-name and opposed the US decision to &quot;cut off supply&quot; to WHO.
It&#39;s worth noting that while criticizing the Trump administration&#39;s response to the New Coronary Pneumonia Epidemic Policy, Gates has also repeatedly expressed appreciation to the media for China&#39;s anti-epidemic measures.
In an interview with CNN on March 26, Gates mentioned China six times in a 34-minute conversation, noting that China ’s experience is worthy of reference from the United States, and called on the United States to follow the blockade measures China once imposed.
This is apparently unacceptable to some people who are trying to make China &quot;back on the pot.&quot; When Gates defended China again on the 26th and pointed out the shortcomings of the United States, Ryan, a reporter for the &quot;right daily connection&quot; of the American right-wing conservative news media Tweeted hysterically: &quot;This is all a lie!&quot;
Someone in the comments echoed, saying that since Gates spoke for China, he should be asked to move to China.
But there are also many rational netizens who stand up to support Bill Gates:
　　
In fact, Gates himself responded to the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that raged on the Internet.
In an interview with CCTV on April 9, Gates said: &quot;I think this is ironic, especially for those who are doing their best to help the world prepare for the epidemic. But the situation is a bit crazy at the moment. Avoid creating a lot of incredible rumors. &quot;
Not only is it &quot;unbelievable&quot;, but some people have even threatened Gates&#39; personal safety. The New York Times said that after Gates said that the US government had “cut off” the WHO, someone on the Internet borrowed a poster from the movie “Kill Bill” to promote “kill Bill Gates”.
Gates was not the only one facing death threats. CNN host Trevor Noah was similarly intimidated by interviewing Gates and talking about vaccines.
According to another CNN report, Anthony Forsy, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also threatened with death. After receiving the report, the US police strengthened the protection of his home and family.
Interestingly, all three of them have commented on the Trump administration&#39;s response to the epidemic, and they all opposed the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; when talking about China.
For example, in Noah ’s interview with Gates, the two had objectively discussed China ’s anti-epidemic measures and pointed out their merits. Fossi explicitly denied the so-called &quot;virus came from a Chinese laboratory&quot;.
But despite facing all kinds of malicious speculation, Gates still insisted on advancing the fight against epidemic. The British &quot;Times&quot; 24th article said that in an interview, Gates said: &quot;The new crown pandemic is like a world war, but this time we are in the same camp.
&quot;Science, not politics, is the key to solving this crisis and preventing future epidemics.&quot; He emphasized.
