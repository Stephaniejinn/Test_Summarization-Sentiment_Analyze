Title : Influenza; Research Results from University of Guelph Update Understanding of Influenza (Phylogenetic Inference of H3N2 Canine Influenza A Outbreak in Ontario, Canada in 2018)

2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- A new study on Influenza is now available. According to news reporting out of Guelph, Canada, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "The first Canadian H3N2 canine influenza A outbreak involving an Asian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) began in southwestern Ontario, Canada, in late December 2017. More H3N2 CIV cases were identified in central and eastern Ontario between March and October 2018."
Funders for this research include Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, "Based on epidemiological investigation, 5 clusters were identified (C1, C2, C3a, C3b, and C4); however, the origin of infection has only been revealed for epidemiological cluster C1. Here, we use phylogenetic analyses to unravel the links of virus transmission between the 5 epidemiological clusters and the origin of infection for all epidemiological clusters. Our results demonstrate that the Canadian H3N2 CIV sequences were grouped into four distinct phylogenetic clusters with minimal genetic diversity between these clusters. Large scale phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 CIV from around the globe showed that the Canadian CIVs formed a distinct new clade along with CIVs that have been circulating in the USA since 2017-2018 and in China since 2017. This clade shares a common ancestor of Asian origin."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "This study concludes that the H3N2 CIV outbreak in Ontario was driven by multiple introductions of South Korean/Chinese-origin H3N2 CIVs over 10 months."
