Title : Acute myocardial infarctions and stroke triggered by... -

   Background  Several studies have investigated a possible association between respiratory infection and acute myocardial infarction (MI). As both influenza and pneumococcal infections are vaccine preventable, understanding the populations affected by virus-induced cardiovascular complications is important to guide public health and clinical practice.    Aim  This observational study aimed to quantify the association between laboratory-confirmed respiratory bacteria or virus infections and risk of first MI or stroke, by using self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis of anonymised linked electronic Danish health records.    Methods  The SCCS method was used to determine the relative incidence of the first event of MI and stroke occurring within 28   days after laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections compared with the baseline time period.    Results  In the age and season adjusted analyses for first acute MI, the incidence ratios (IR) of a MI event occurring during the risk period were significantly elevated following a  Streptococcus pneumoniae  infection with values of 20.1, 11.0 and 4.9 during 1   3, 4   7 and 8   14   days, respectively and following respiratory virus infection with values of 15.2, 4.5 and 4.4 during 1   3, 8   14 and 15   28   days, respectively. The significantly elevated IRs for stroke following an  S. pneumoniae  infection were 25.5 and 6.3 during 1   3 and 8   14   days, respectively and following respiratory virus infection 8.3, 7.8 and 6.2 during 1   3, 4   7 and 8   14   days, respectively.    Conclusion  This study suggested a significant cardiovascular event triggering effect following infection with  S. pneumoniae  and respiratory viruses (mainly influenza), indicating the importance of protection against vaccine-preventable respiratory infections.
