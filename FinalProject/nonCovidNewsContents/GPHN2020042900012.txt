Title : What has happened to eggs in Ireland? Bird flu outbreak causes production to plummet
Ariticle : 
Egg production in Ireland has plummeted by as much as 15% in places
A bird flu outbreak has caused a drop in egg production in Ireland.
The H6N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in ten flocks in Co Monaghan, according to the Department of Agriculture.
It is understood that eight of these outbreaks are in table egg laying flocks, while two are turkey groups.
Egg production has plummeted by as much as 15% in parts and the Irish Egg Association has confirmed that half a million hens have been culled due to the avian flu, RTE News reports.
However the Department of Agriculture has clarified that the outbreak is not a public health concern.
It also confirmed that four other flocks that were tested for the influenza have been confirmed as negative.
A spokesman said: "The Department has been working closely with representatives of the sector and flock owners to discuss a number of measures aimed at controlling the current outbreak.
"Poultry flocks are currently engaged in the adoption of a series of biosecurity measures, aimed at mitigating the risk of transmission of the disease to other flocks.
"The sector has acted very promptly in voluntarily culling the affected flocks with a view to minimising the spread of the disease."
