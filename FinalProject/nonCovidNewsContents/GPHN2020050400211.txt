Title : Coronavirus, influenza and dengue in Jalisco
Ariticle : 
The coronavirus pandemic, coupled with outbreaks of dengue and influenza, threaten to become the 'Perfect Storm' in Jalisco. The contagion rate of covid-19 in this entity is in the last three places in recent weeks, resulting from an effective, successful and commendable strategy to contain it, despite having: 1) an urban population amounting to 87%; 2) the second largest metropolitan area (of Guadalajara) in terms of population in Mexico [only surpassed by that of the Valley of Mexico]; and 3) one of the four states with the highest number of migrants in the United States â€“ the current epicenter of the pandemic.
Contrary to this, the epidemiological indicators of dengue are very worrying by 2020. Based on data provided by the Directorate-General for Epidemiology, Jalisco reported 220 'confirmed cases' of dengue until epidemiological week 17 [closing at April 27, 2020]. But last year, Jalisco recorded only 177 confirmed cases during the same date. Today we see an increase of 24 per cent compared to the same period in 2019. While in 2019, the number of cases with 'severe dengue' amounted to three; in 2020, the number climbed to 23: that is, it grew by 667 percent. In relation to cases of 'dengue with alarm signs', 26 in 2019 was posted; however, by 2020 the figure is already 48 cases during the same period (an increase of 33% compared to the previous year). Finally, cases of 'non-serious dengue' increased from 138 to 149, from 2019 to 2020, to indicate growth of eight per cent.
This data is particularly sensitive, since Jalisco topped, during 2019, the national ranking of the dengue epidemic with: I) More 'confirmed deaths', with 49:II) More 'deaths under study', with 80; III), More 'probable cases', with 81 thousand 188; IV) More 'confirmed cases', with 11 thousand 727; V) Higher 'incidence of confirmed cases' per 100 thousand inhabitants, with a rate of 141.6; 'estimated case incidence', with a rate of 637.9. A disaster! So far in 2020, in a few weeks we move from sixth place, to the fourth national site in dengue cases. The epidemiological landscape is more complex, if it is also considered that the rains do not yet start, when the critical stage of dengue is foreseen.
As opposed to coronavirus, which mainly affects people over the age of 60; with dengue, the exact opposite is true: the age sector with the highest incidence of contagion ranks from five to 19 years. The dengue records its most critical incidence of contagion during the last quarter of each year, a period in which the 'second wave' of coronavirus is expected globally, due to dry and cold weather. Note that at the close of epidemiological week 18 2020, Jalisco already has the highest number of influenza deaths nationwide, with 36. The huge mistake in the prevention of dengue, during 2019, must alert the authorities to the need for an absolutely different plan to deal with dengue; in addition to the influenza and the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.
