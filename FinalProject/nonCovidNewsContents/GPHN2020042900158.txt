2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- Current study results on RNA Viruses - Influenza A Virus have been published. According to news originating from Delemont, Switzerland, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Influenza infections have been associated with high morbidity. The aims were to determine predictors of mortality among patients with influenza infections and to ascertain the role of quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) in predicting poor outcomes."
Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Internal Medicine, "All adult patients with influenza infection at the Hospital of Jura, Switzerland during four influenza seasons (2014/15 to 2017/18) were included. Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV was used during the first three influenza seasons and Cobas Influenza A/B and RSV during the 2017/18 season. Among 1684 influenza virus tests performed, 441 patients with influenza infections were included (238 for influenza A virus and 203 for B). The majority of infections were community onset (369; 83.7%). Thirty-day mortality was 6.0% (25 patients). Multivariate analysis revealed that infection due to A virus (P 0.035; OR 7.1; 95% CI 1.1-43.8), malnutrition (P < 0.001; OR 25.0; 95% CI 4.5-138.8), hospital-acquired infection (P 0.003; OR 12.2; 95% CI 2.3-65.1), respiratory insufficiency (PaO2/FiO(2) < 300) (P < 0.001; OR 125.8; 95% CI 9.6-1648.7) and pulmonary infiltrate on X-ray ( P 0.020; OR 6.0; 95% CI 1.3-27.0) were identified as predictors of mortality. qSOFA showed a very good accuracy (0.89) equivalent to other more specific and burdensome scores such as CURB-65 and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). qSOFA performed similarly to specific severity scores (PSI, CURB-65) in predicting mortality."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Infection by influenza A virus, respiratory insufficiency and malnutrition were associated with worse prognosis."
