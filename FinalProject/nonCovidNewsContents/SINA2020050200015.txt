Original title: Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet: China is right, we are wrong
In an interview with Bai Yansong, Richard Houghton, editor-in-chief of the international leading medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, said on May 1 that the experience of the Chinese national defense epidemic that can be shared with the world is a quick and decisive decision.
Horton said that China&#39;s experience is a quick and decisive decision. This is for a reason. China has experience in dealing with the SARS virus. At that time, SARS suddenly hit, and China was also caught off guard. I think the Chinese government is determined to make changes after the SARS epidemic. Over the past 20 years, China has invested heavily in hospitals and health systems, and has also invested heavily in scientific research in some universities. Therefore, when the new outbreak of pneumonia occurred in December last year, China had such scientific research capabilities and medical resources to cope with the outbreak. At the same time, China also has the political capacity. Because China understands that the epidemic is similar to the SARS virus and poses a great threat to Chinese society, it makes a decisive decision. Western European countries do not think that this is a virus similar to SARS, but similar to influenza. We think that this epidemic is at most another wave of influenza, and it does not pay attention to its danger. We think that influenza is not a very serious disease. This virus can spread among people and protect us after causing &quot;group immunity&quot;, but in fact this is a serious judgment error. China is right, we are wrong.
