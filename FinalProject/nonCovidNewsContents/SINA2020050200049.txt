Original title: Terracotta Warriors VS Liberty! Xinhua News Agency video is on fire abroad
[Text / Observer Net Zhao Noah] &quot;We found a new virus, it is dangerous ...&quot; &quot;This is just a flu!&quot;
On April 30, Xinhua News Agency posted a video called &quot;Once upon a Virus&quot; on Twitter, which attracted wide attention.
In the video, the LEGO villain representing China continually publishes effective information of the new coronavirus to the world, while the LEGO villain representing the United States of America, constantly denies it.
In the end, the LEGO villain of Liberty blushed and started to drip. . . . .
Once the video was released, it immediately received the attention of Twitter users and mainstream Western media. Although the media, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), unwillingly call it China&#39;s &quot;political propaganda&quot;, most rational netizens said that the video is true and the Trump administration&#39;s response is real Too bad.
&quot;Virus Past&quot;: The United States ignored warnings and discredited China
At the beginning, the time was shown as January. A LEGO figure wearing a mask appeared on the left side of the screen, warning the world: &quot;(We) have a strange case of pneumonia.&quot; ) Appeared on the right and responded: &quot;Received!&quot;
The time went to January, and the villain continued to issue a warning message against the new coronary pneumonia: this is a new virus, it is very dangerous, we have to wear masks, and still have to stay at home. We built a hospital in only ten days. . . . . .
The villain liberty constantly denies the warning message: this is just a kind of flu, there is no need to wear a mask. As for the isolation order? This is a &quot;human rights violation&quot;! It only takes ten days to build a hospital? This is &quot;show off&quot;.
Two months later, the epidemic situation in the small population of terracotta warriors became more severe: New coronary pneumonia patients filled the hospital, doctors sacrificed heroically, and the virus spread through the air. But at the same time, there were constantly new doctors behind the villain, symbolizing China&#39;s efforts to support Hubei at that time, and the &quot;white angels&quot; dedicated themselves to fight the epidemic.
But the villain liberty is still not taken seriously. In addition to the old tunes calling China ’s isolation orders “human rights violations”, it also claimed that the virus would “miraclely disappear” in April.
In March, the number of confirmed cases in China declined, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa appeared in the picture, indicating that the epicenter of the epidemic has shifted from China to Europe. The person&#39;s face started to turn red, and a bit of dripping started.
In April, the villain, who appeared to be in poor condition, started &quot;nonsense&quot;: &quot;The virus is not dangerous at all, but millions of Chinese people are dead. Even if the virus is not dangerous, we are right ... . We have done nothing for three months, because the WHO recognizes China and we want to stop funding it. &quot;
The Terracotta villain said helplessly: &quot;Are you really listening to what you are saying?&quot;
In the end, the villain liberty said: &quot;We have always been correct, even if our claims contradict each other.&quot; At this time, the villain liberty put on a mask.
The video ends with the &quot;Tu Tucao&quot; of the last Terracotta Warrior: &quot;This is where I love your Americans best-your inertia.&quot;
Australian media did not report with good intentions. Netizens: How can this be called &quot;political propaganda&quot;?
Once released, &quot;Virus Past&quot; immediately received a lot of attention and comments from netizens. As of press time, this video of Xinhua News Agency has received 1.52 million views on Twitter, more than 15,000 retweets, and more than 28,000 likes. In addition to the repost by the Chinese Embassy in France, Western mainstream media including the US Newsweek, the French Figaro, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) have all reported on this.
Although these media do not call this video China&#39;s &quot;political propaganda&quot; with good intentions, they also admit that the words of the villain of freedom are indeed justified. For example, the villain of Liberty once said that the virus will &quot;miraclely disappear&quot; in April. The quote here is exactly what Trump said in February this year: &quot;Many people think they will disappear in April because The weather will be hot and the temperature will be high. Generally speaking, high temperature will kill such a virus. &quot;
Under the relevant news tweets, most rational netizens believe that the video is true, the Trump administration has indeed responded too badly, and against the accusations of &quot;political propaganda&quot; by Western media, netizens questioned: This is all the truth, how Can it be called political propaganda?
Under the source video of Xinhua News Agency, the one with the highest number of comments posted a video showing the video of Trump holding a campaign rally, playing golf, and denying the danger of the virus since the outbreak in China. The netizen also commented: &quot;WHO issued a warning about new coronary pneumonia as early as January, while Trump is playing golf (clown).&quot;
Below the Twitter reported by ABC, the one with the highest number of likes pointed out that (until now) Trump still does not understand (the severity of the epidemic).
The second highest commented comment said: &quot;(Video) correctly shows the fact that all incompetent governments ignore real information. Australia has no problem, and the United States needs to ask the president the truth.&quot;
Of course, there are many netizens who accuse and discredit China, but just as a netizen said: &quot;I like watching you deny this video, you are like the West shown in the video.&quot;
Many more people discussed the term &quot;political propaganda&quot; used by Western media when commenting on the video: &quot;Whether it is political propaganda or not, the portrayal of the United States in the video is quite in place.&quot;
&quot;Why do you call this political propaganda? To me, this (video) is like a simple collection of fact declarations.&quot;
