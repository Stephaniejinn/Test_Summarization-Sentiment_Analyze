Ariticle :

It said the person was in a stable condition and there were still no cases of Covid-19 in Bougainville.
But it said samples continued to be taken from "persons of interest."
Meanwhile a quarantine facility and an isolation facility were both nearly ready for use, in case they were needed.
The Bougainville President, John Momis, previously said that it was vital for Bougainville to keep the virus out of the region because it lacked the capacity to deal with an outbreak.
