Title : INFLUENZA VACCINATION: Additional strategies needed for older adults
Ariticle : 
Current guidelines prioritize older adults for vaccination against seasonal influenza, but how effective is this strategy? Here, a study which found that vaccination alone had only a modest impact on reducing hospitalization and mortality in this vulnerable population, suggesting that additional strategies are needed, is discussed. The study produced no evidence that vaccination significantly reduced hospitalization or mortality in older adults, although the researchers write that these findings "do not preclude modest effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against severe outcomes." They conclude that these findings raise questions about the overall effectiveness of a vaccination strategy that is limited to standard vaccines and focuses too much on elderly persons.
