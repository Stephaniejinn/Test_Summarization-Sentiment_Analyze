Title : Hungary reports H5N8 strain of bird flu
Ariticle : 
BUDAPEST, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The H5N8 type of avian influenza has been detected in 226 livestock farms in southern Hungary, local media reported on Tuesday.
Totally "3.5 million animals were killed in the farms affected by the virus infection, of which 870,000 as a precaution," Lajos Bognar, chief veterinary officer of Hungary was quoted by business portal Haszon (Profit) as saying.
 The rapid spread of the bird flu was also supported by recent windy, often stormy weather, he added.
 Bognar also said that similarly to other European countries, the avian influenza was most likely imported to Hungary by migrating wild birds.
 In concerned Bacs-Kiskun and Csongrad counties in south Hungary, the livestock density had to be reduced to prevent the spread of the virus, he added.
