Title : NDMC examins 355 patients with flu-like symptoms
Ariticle : 
NEW DELHI, April 29 -- The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has examined 355 patients in a fortnight for 'Influenza-Like Illnesses' (ILI) which is a Covid-19 mandatory indicator. The civic body had set up a 'unique' 24x7 flu corner at the Charak Palika Hospital (CPH) earlier this month with an aim to safely screen potential corona-infected patients without putting healthcare workers at risk.
Out of the total 355 patients in flu corner, 12 patients were found with respiratory infection and 53 patients were related to the fever since less than seven days, a senior SDMC official said, adding that these are all the Covid-19 mandatory indicators.
However, total number of OPD patients was 2861 but only 355 patients were found fever or Influenza like illnesses related symptoms, he added.
Explaining about the features of the center, he said that this is the first time in Delhi such facility is set up. 'Health Care Provider' (HCP) and patients are separated with a glass barriers at this flu corner. "It provides requisite protection to the healthcare providers (doctors and other medical staff) while saving on personal protective equipment (PPE) used,' he said.
In the background of COVID-19 pandemic, this facilitates healthcare providers to examine the patients without putting themselves at risk of infection, he said, adding that the design involves a temporary structure made of canvas with a glass partition, he said.
The official said that flu corner is constructed in an open area, away from the main Hospital within its premises and is run 24x7. "The glass partition with microphone facility provides effective protection at the time of patient interaction with the healthcare provider," he added.
