Title : Vaccine shortage
Ariticle : 
THIS refers to the dearth in Gujrat of pentavalent, or penta vaccine, which protects against five diseases, including haemophilus influenza, pertussis or whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B.
Children are inoculated at the age of six weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks. Owing to the non-availability of the vaccine at government hospitals for more than three months, many newborns could not be immunised during the recent vaccination programme. This can put children's lives at risk.
The authorities concerned should make arrangements for vaccine as soon as possible.
