Title : Jared Diamond: "The Covid-19 does not threaten human existence; climate change, yes"
Ariticle : 
"My lady and I, my children and my sister are alive and healthy, still, and I thank you for it," says Jared Diamond (82) from her home in California. These days he spends most of his time inside, chatting with his wife, playing piano, writing articles and answering inquiries around Covid-19 for international media, except when he goes for a walk to observe birds. This quarantine, he adds, "it doesn't look like anything I've ever experienced, except a crystal plague I had as a child that forced me to keep a bed for two weeks."
The press's interest in his impressions of the ongoing pandemic was justified by his mere status as the author of the blockbuster Arms, Germs and Steel (1997), the same one where he noted that we humans, and our pathogens "are locked in an escalation of evolutionary competition, with the death of a contender as the price of defeat, and with natural selection playing the role of"arbitrator." But it is worth adding to that the appearance, just over a month ago, of the column The Next Virus, co-written together with the virologist Nathan Wolfe.
Published in several countries and languages, the text calls for the next virus to think now, "because in 2004, when the Sars epidemic occurred, we did not and, because of this, we have not been able to avoid the current epidemic, which almost certainly had a very similar origin to that of sars".
"Most countries failed to anticipate the next virus, even though we all had to anticipate that there would be one," says the geographer and evolutionary biologist today, "because they have been constantly appearing: HIV, mad cow disease, Sars, Mers, Ebola and others." That said, nuancedly, there were those who got ahead of themselves: Vietnam, which learned from the Sars that killed many people in 2003, "hence, when the Covid-19 crisis kicked off the Wuhan animal market, it adopted a severe policy of confinement and tracing," and Finland, which "anticipated the virus and thus anticipated every possible crisis." After the harsh learning of its wars against the Soviet Union (1939-44), the government created committees and institutions to anticipate any major crises. And for the current one, he had stored masks, grains, fuel and drugs. "The Finns are prepared for anything."
In China and Italy"If a perverse alien wanted to infect humans from a zoonosis [animal-friendly disease], the most effective method would be to put as many species in contact with as many humans as possible. And what would be the best solution? A Chinese wildlife market."
In the above-mentioned column, Diamond and Wolfe note that the Beijing government's first reaction was to downplay the facts. But they "immediately "moved on to a much more energetic attitude, with the implementation of an unprecedented series of measures to limit transmission, the benefits of which appear to have been radical. In addition, China has sought to prevent the emergence of other zoonoses by finally closing wild animal markets and definitively eliminating their trade as food."
-How feasible is it to maintain these kinds of measures over time, thus altering the habits of millions of people, even under an authoritarian regime?
-Authoritarian China is not the only country that altered the habits of millions. Democratic Italy belatedly altered the habits of tens of millions of Italians.
-In the discussions of the present, the issue of wild animal markets has crossed with some global trend againstmeat production and consumption. How decisive can this issue be in the coming years?
-The consumption of pet meat is an independent theme of the wild animal markets in Asia. These markets are of relatively minor importance as sources of meat. The good reasons to reduce our consumption of pet meat are not on the side of reducing the risk of infections, but for reducing the impact on the planet: every kilo of meat from a pet requires about nine kilos of vegetation to be produced.
-How avoidable is a new pandemic?
-A new pandemic such as covid-19 can be avoided in two ways: by closing the other routes of transmission of viruses from animals to humans (especially the Chinese trade in traditional medicine, which is independent of that of wild animal markets), and by learning from the Finns when it comes to being prepared.
"There is no solid biological reason why a future epidemic will not kill hundreds of millions," it is stated in the column published in March. How limited are the chances of finding a way out, or at least keeping these diseases under control?
-Probably next year, when we have developed a vaccine, we will have the Covid under control. Now, even if it infected Earth's 7.7 billion inhabitants, and even if 2% of them died, the death toll would be "only" 154 million. That would still leave 7,546,000,000 people alive on the planet. In other words, Covid is not a threat to human existence, while climate change, natural resource depletion, inequality and nuclear weapons are. The latter can kill us all or ruin everyone's standard of living; Covid can't do that.
-From an evolutionary point of view, such as the one you use in weapons, germs and steel, can viruses be said to find more efficient ways to transmit Covid-19, while humans seek to be even more efficient in preventing their spread?
-Viruses are not looking for anything, and humans do not try to be more efficient in preventing the spread of diseases. Rather, the symptoms produced in us by viruses are a result of natural selection: viruses that lead us to have reactions that spread them, create more "baby viruses" than those that do not cause those reactions. Our sneezing and coughing when we have Covid - or measles, or smallpox - spread those pathogens, without viruses looking for anything and without us trying to be efficient.
-The present crisis forces us to protect ourselves and others by avoiding doing things that we "naturally" do, such as touching and embracing...
-Humans do "naturally" all sorts of bad things: we have impulses that promote our selfish interest by killing, stealing, lying and other behaviors considered "normal". It is essential for any human society to tame these selfish behaviors - or individuals - to benefit everyone else.
