Title : Data show COVID-19 more deadly than the flu
Ariticle : 
Data from the state Department of Health show that there have been far more deaths attributable to COVID-19 this year than to influenza since the flu season started in October, which seems to support assertions that the coronavirus is more deadly to those who experience symptoms than the flu.
According to the DOH, clinical, commercial and public laboratories in Pennsylvania reported 129,912 cases of the flu confirmed through lab tests between Oct. 6 and March 28; and 102 deaths in Pennsylvania have been attributed the influenza in that same period.
The number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in laboratory tests statewide this year has reached 43,264 as of midnight Monday, while the number of deaths in Pennsylvania attributed to COVID-19 stands at 1,716.
This would seem to suggest that, at least in Pennsylvania, COVID-19 is much deadlier than the flu, with a flu mortality rate of 0.08% and a COVID-19 mortality rate of 4.0%, based solely on the number of cases of each virus confirmed by laboratory tests and the number of deaths attributed to each virus.
The DOH reported 2,078 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 74 COVID-19 deaths in Luzerne County as of midnight Tuesday. The agency also reported 3,745 flu confirmed cases in Luzerne County during the 2019-20 flu season.
The DOH did not provide a breakdown of flu deaths by county for this flu season. But according to data from the department's Enterprise Data Dissemination Informatics Exchange, Luzerne County saw a total of 35 deaths attributable to the flu between 2013 and 2017, ranging from a low of four deaths in 2013 to a high of 16 in 2015.
Nate Wardle, DOH press secretary, said it's important to note the influenza case counts presented on the department's influenza webpage are restricted to only those cases that have had a positive laboratory test for flu (by rapid test, DFA, PCR or culture) reported to the department.
Wardle said these case counts represent "only a fraction of the actual burden of illness due to influenza occurring in the commonwealth at any given time. This is because most persons with influenza do not go to the doctor or are not tested or reported."
He said the spread and severity of influenza varies widely from season to season. It is estimated that 5% to 20% (600,000 to 2.4 million) Pennsylvanians get the flu each year, and 120 to 2,000 die from complications of influenza.
"With that said, because many people who have the flu stay home, or do not get tested, we know that our data is a significant undercount. We do believe our death data is close to being accurate, as many people who die from the flu would be identified," Wardle said.
"Similarly, for COVID-19, DOH case data is a significant undercount, as many people have been told to stay home and not get tested during the mitigation stage of the COVID-19 emergency," he said.
Wardle said department officials believe the COVID-19 death data will be accurate, "but we will likely need to be several weeks past seeing the highest numbers of cases to allow the data to catch up."
Based on the state estimation for flu cases and deaths, the mortality rate could range somewhere between 0.01% and 0.33%.
No reliable estimation is yet available for the total number of COVID-19 cases in the state or in the United States, for that matter.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 981,246 cases of COVID-19 in the United States as of April 27, and 55,258 COVID-19 deaths. The case total includes 3,587 probable cases and total deaths includes 5,654 probable deaths.
The CDC notes on its website that agency officials do not know the exact number of COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths for a variety of reasons.
Wardle said that while the two viruses have many differences, the flu and COVID-19 share one major similarity â€” their effect on senior citizens, as a large percentage of both flu and COVID-19 deaths are among those 65 and over.
In Pennsylvania, 70 of the 102 flu deaths were among those 65 and older.
