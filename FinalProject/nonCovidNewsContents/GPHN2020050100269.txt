Title : Bavarian Nordic secures new USD202-mil. contract with BARDA for smallpox vaccine
Ariticle : 
Bavarian Nordic (Denmark) announced on 30 April that the company had secured a new two-year contract valued at potentially up to USD202 million to supply the US government with an additional 1.4 million liquid frozen doses of Jynneos (smallpox and monkeypox vaccine, live non-replicating) for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox in adults at high risk of infection. The deal marks an extension from a pre-existing 10-year contract, struck between Bavarian Nordic and the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), to supply the US preparedness and pandemic response service (see United States: 26 September 2019: Bavarian Nordic receives FDA approval for smallpox vaccine, garners priority review voucher).
Significance: The vaccine’s supply to the US Strategic National Stockpile for use in an emergency marks an important additional in terms of the US preparedness and future pandemic prevention strategy. The Jynneos vaccine provides an important improvement over replicating smallpox vaccines in that it is approved for a broad population, including individuals with weakened immune systems and those with eczema, who are at high risk of developing adverse reactions with the traditional replicating vaccine.
