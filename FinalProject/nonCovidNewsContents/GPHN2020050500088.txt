Title : 69 influenza-like infection cases found in Dhanbad's sealed DS Colony
Ariticle : 
Dhanbad, May 5 -- A total of 69 residents carrying Influenza-Like Infection (ILI) symptoms in sealed containment area of DS Colony have left the health department in a tizzy.
One positive case of the two in Dhanbad was found in DS Colony which is in heart of coal city and ever since the area has been sealed for precaution. However, the patient has been discharged from hospital and put in home quarantine in colony quarter till May 11.
Senior medical officer-cum-incharge of the containment area, Dr Alok Viswakarma, said after recovery of the positive case, more than 2.65 lakh residents living in 40,616 houses in the three-km radius of DS Colony were screened. ILI symptoms were found in 69 people and they have been asked to remain in home quarantine for 14 days.
"A team of doctors and health staffers was sent to the containment area again to scan those 69 cases and ensure they were in strict home quarantine," said Dr Viswakarma.
Meanwhile, a senior medical officer said 44 migrated labours arrived Dhanbad on May 2 from Telangana.
Among them, 21 were from Dhanbad sadar area. As per guidelines, they have to remain in 14 days' home quarantine but they are seen mingling with other people at public places and sharing their experiences of lockdown in Hyderabad.
"The main concern is that they have returned from corona-affected states and can be carriers. But due to lack of monitoring, they are reportedly roaming around rather than living in quarantine in their houses," said the officer.
Since April 18, no new case has surfaced in Dhanbad. Though both the positive patients have been discharged from hospitals after recovery, both containment areas are still sealed.
