2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly - According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:
“We write with concerns regarding the interpretation of the results by the authors and its popular interpretation in the press, owing to the use of inappropriately formulated dietary controls throughout the study.
“While the findings point to a potentially important therapeutic effect of dietary modification on immune function and protection from influenza A viral infection, the design of the dietary interventions reported in Goldberg, et al., 2019 is confounded by the use of inappropriately matched comparator diets. The consequences of these unmatched diets result in substantial composition mismatching when comparing across the 4 test diets, obviating our ability to make causal inferences about the dietary factors impacting the observed phenotypes.
“This has potentially important translational implications.”
