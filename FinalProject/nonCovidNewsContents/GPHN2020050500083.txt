Title : The Government of Buenos Aires has already spread 190,000 older adults against the flu
Ariticle : 
The City's Ministry of Health vaccinated 190,000 older adults against influenza (strain 2020) through the vaccination plan for people over 65, the main risk group for coronavirus. Some 8,000 women attended vaccinations on Monday. The plan continues on Tuesday with the men whose ID ends at 8.
Unlike other years, this time vaccines are administered in 82 points, with four vaccinatators each located in: 48 schools, 17 churches, 10 cultural centers and 7 day centers; distributed in all the Communes of the City. A decentralized system was designed that allows older adults to have a vaccination as close to home as possible. This prevents members of the main risk group from having to go to hospitals and health centres.
Vaccines are given in 82 points, with four vaccinatators each located in schools, churches, cultural centers and day centers distributed in all communes.
The call is made according to the last number of ID to divide and classify the attention to the elderly. This seeks to make older adults as few rows as possible, if that happens they will be done within each center and maintaining the preventive distance between person and person.
It is especially requested that everyone respect the day they have stipulated to be vaccinated. These dates can be quickly found on the City's WhatsApp (1150500147), writing "Anti-Influenza Campaign". The chatbot indicates according to gender and last NUMBER of ID what is the corresponding date, and by location, what is the nearest point.
For inquiries contact the City WhatsApp (1150500147).
Some 1,000 people work in the operation among nurses, vaccinators, administrative, logistics, assistance and security personnel. Vaccination hours are 9 to 15 hours. The vaccination schedule follows as follows:
Tuesday, May 5, men finished in 8.Wednesday, May 6, women's finishing on 9.Thursday, May 7, men finished in 9. Vaccination hours are 9 to 15 hours.
It is very important that older adults are vaccinated against the flu because while the vaccine does not serve covid19 the flu can also put health at risk.
Children under 65 who are in other risk groups or who must be vaccinated against the flu on a medical basis will be included in the shift schedule.
There will be no flu vaccination for older adults in porte√±o hospitals or CESAC because they are working with the coronavirus pandemic.
