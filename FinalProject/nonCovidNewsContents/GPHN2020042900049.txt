Title : Influenza vaccine is best option
Ariticle : 
The community has been urged to be vigilant about getting their flu shot with the arrival of the vaccine to the area recently.
Close to 450 cases of the flu were recorded in the Townsville district, including Ayr, up until April 5.
Ayr Health Service director of nursing Tracey Gabiola said the COVID-19 pandemic added further criticality to getting the influenza vaccine.
“The flu vaccine is now available for the community to receive at their local GP or pharmacy and this will go a long way in protecting yourself and the community,” Ms Gabiola said.
“It is the most simple, effective measure people can take to avoid getting influenza A.” “We already know the flu is in our community and can make people very unwell, keeping them out of work, school or recreation for weeks at a time.” Ms Gabriola said influenza could be a serious viral illness for vulnerable people in the community.
“It isn’t the same as the common cold and can lead to serious complications, particularly in the very young, elderly and people with complex chronic diseases,” she said.
“Eligible Queenslanders can receive the government-funded vaccine free of charge and other community members can purchase the vaccine at their doctor or pharmacy.” Ms Gabiola said the Ayr Health Service was stocked with government-funded vaccines for people aged over 65 and the service was expecting a stock of the vaccine for children aged between six months and five years.
“These people will be able to visit us at the Ayr Health Service to receive their vaccine; however, I encourage the rest of the community to visit their GP or pharmacist,” she said.
