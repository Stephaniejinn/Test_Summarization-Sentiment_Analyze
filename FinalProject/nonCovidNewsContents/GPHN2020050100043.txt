Title : FLU VACCINES SHOULD BE FREE
Ariticle : 
Not funding flu vaccinations for people living with mental health and addiction issues is "unkind and discriminatory", a pharmacist leader says.
That's because they're more likely to have physical illnesses and poor health outcomes, a statement from the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand said.
But Pharmac people says those in inpatient care get funded vaccines, and there's not enough evidence of increased flu risk to also fund it for those who aren't.
"This exclusion by Pharmac is contrary to the prevailing evidence, it is unkind and discriminatory," Pharmaceutical Society president Ian McMichael said in a statement.
The society, with members of the Aotearoa New Zealand Equally Well collaborative, is asking Pharmac to change its free influenza vaccine criteria to include people with mental health and addiction issues.
About half of the adults in contact with specialist mental health and addiction services will be able to get funded influenza vaccines through other categories - for example because they are over 65, McMichael said.
But protecting the other half is especially important in the Covid-19 environment, he said.
Pharmac said there wasn't enough evidence to show people with serious mental health conditions and addiction were at increased risk of influenza, or that they were more likely to get the vaccine at a pharmacy than in general practice.
"If the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand has more evidence to support this funding application, then we would gladly take it to our clinical experts for assessment and advice," Pharmac director of operations Lisa Williams said.
