2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- New research on Life Science Research - Genetics is the subject of a report. According to news originating from Fujian, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Two novel resistant QTLs mapped and candidate genes identified for Aspergillus flavus resistance in cultivated peanut using SLAF-seq. Aflatoxin contamination in peanuts caused by Aspergillus flavus is a serious food safety issue for human health around the world."
Financial support for this research came from National Science Foundation of P.R. China.
Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, "Host plant resistance to fungal infection and reduction in aflatoxin are crucial for mitigating this problem. Identification of the resistance-linked markers can be used in marker-assisted breeding for varietal development. Here we report construction of two high-density genetic linkage maps with 1975 SNP loci and 5022 SNP loci, respectively. Two consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified as qRAF-3-1 and qRAF-14-1, which located on chromosomes A03 and B04, respectively. QTL qRAF-3-1 was mapped within 1.67 cM and had more than 19% phenotypic variance explained (PVE), while qRAF-14-1 was located within 1.34 cM with 5.15% PVE. While comparing with the reference genome, the mapped QTLs, qRAF-3-1 and qRAF-14-1, were located within a physical distance of 1.44 Megabase pair (Mbp) and 2.22 Mbp, harboring 67 and 137 genes, respectively. Among the identified candidate genes, six genes with the same function were found within both QTLs regions. In addition, putative disease resistance RPP13-like protein 1 (RPP13), lipoxygenase (Lox), WRKY transcription factor (WRKY) and cytochrome P450 71B34 genes were also identified. Using microarray analysis, genes responded to A. flavus infection included coding for RPP13, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing-like protein, and Lox which may be possible candidate genes for resistance to A. flavus."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "The QTLs and candidate genes will further facilitate marker development and validation of genes for deployment in the molecular breeding programs against A. flavus in peanuts."
