Hong Kong health officials reported this week they are investigating a case of human infection of 
rat Hepatitis E virus (HEV).
The case involves a 61-year-old male. He was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for management due to underlying illnesses on April 7 and was found to have a deranged liver function on April 12. His condition has improved and he was transferred to Tung Wah Hospital for rehabilitation April 29. The patient’s blood sample tested positive for rat HEV upon laboratory testing.
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient resided in Southern District. According to his home contacts, no rodents or their excreta were noticed in their residence. The patient had no travel history during the incubation period and his home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far.
“Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined. The CHP’s investigation is ongoing,” a spokesman for the CHP said.
