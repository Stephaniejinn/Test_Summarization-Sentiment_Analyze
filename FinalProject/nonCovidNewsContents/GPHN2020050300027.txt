Title : Meghalaya puts curbs on inter-dist transport of pigs
Ariticle : 
SHILLONG, May 2 -- The Meghalaya Government today decided to impose more curbs on inter-district transportation of pigs in the State after the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) confirmed African Swine Flu as the cause of pig deaths in the North East. The State Government on Monday banned the import of pigs after a spike in deaths of the animal was reported from some districts in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 'The ICAR laboratory in Bhopal has confirmed that African Swine Fever has infected pigs in the NE States,' Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong said today. He said the State Government has decided to continue with the ban on import of pigs and also put additional curbs on inter-district import and export of pigs. 'We have instructed all veterinary officers to remain alert and visit government and private piggeries on a daily basis and monitor pigs to prevent the spread of the disease in Meghalaya,' he added.
 The Government, however, has not banned sale of pork that is locally available in the State. But it has asked people to exercise caution and cook pork properly before consumption.
