Title : RNA Viruses - Influenza B Virus; Shenzhen Nanshan People's Hospital Researchers Add New Study Findings to Research in Influenza B Virus [Two Cases of Influenza B Virus-Related Fatal Fulminant Pneumonia Complicated With Staphylococcus aureus Infection in â€¦

2020 APR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Life Science Weekly -- Current study results on influenza B virus have been published. According to news reporting originating from Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Two rare cases of Chinese female patients with influenza B virus infection complicated with both fulminant pneumonia and septicemia caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin(PVL) positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MASS) were reported for the first time in China through next-generation sequencing (NGS)."
Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality.
Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Shenzhen Nanshan People's Hospital: "An increasing body of evidence indicates that co-infection with influenza B virus and bacterial pneumonia is often fatal. Rapid and precise identification of the co-infection bacteria can guide the selection of treatment for patients with influenza virus infection in the clinical setting. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was applied for the rapid diagnosis of these two cases. Despite the unfavorable survival outcome of these patients, the application of next-generation sequencing showed promise as a diagnostic tool for the rapid diagnosis of unknown pathogens in patients with bacterial pneumonia and sepsis."
According to the news editors, the research concluded: "This method can guide the administration of medications in such patients."
