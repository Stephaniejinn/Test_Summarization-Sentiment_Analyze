Title : Townsville health workers set record in getting their flu jab
Ariticle : 
TOWNSVILLE Hospital and Health Service has given more than 85 per cent of its staff a flu shot in record time.
In just three weeks, the THHS has vaccinated more staff than it did in all of 2019.
Townsville Hospital and Health Service chief executive Kieran Keyes said the response from health workers had been extraordinary.
“Last year we had a record 4600 staff get their vaccination and this year we are already above 5500,” he said.
“It has been a brilliant response and will make a huge difference in keeping our staff and our patients safe.” Mr Keyes said while COVID-19 had played a role in the record numbers, increased vaccination clinics over public holidays and for night and early shifts had also made a difference. To April 19, there had been 455 confirmed cases of influenza, which is down from 865 cases at the same time in 2019.
Mr Keyes said last year was a record season for influenza across North Queensland with 3579 cases.
“Last year North Queenslanders were admitted to hospital, some required treatment in intensive care and sadly, some died,” he said.
“The best protection against influenza is vaccination. We will be busy responding to one pandemic this year, we don’t want to be managing an influenza outbreak as well.”High-risk groups, including people over the age of 65, pregnant women, those with medical conditions, which increase their risk to severe influenza, children aged between six months and five years and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 15 years and older can receive a free vaccine.
