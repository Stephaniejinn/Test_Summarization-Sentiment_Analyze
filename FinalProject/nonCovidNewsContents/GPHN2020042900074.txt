Title : WHO REPORT; THESE CRIPPLING VIRUS BANS DON'T DO MUCH GOOD
Ariticle : 
Do our leaders know what they're doing as they smash our economy in this virus frenzy?:  
In October last year the World Health Organisation issued ­advice to governments on using “non-pharmaceutical interventions” — such as social distancing, workplace and school closures and travel restrictions — in “future influenza pandemics … based on the latest scientific literature”.
 Hand hygiene and “respiratory etiquette” were recommended at all times. Yet there was precious little evidence for any of the other vast array of interventions governments have enacted.
“We found that there is a ­limited evidence base on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical community mitigation measures,” the WHO concluded, in a document surprisingly dismissive of policies that, a few months later, were embraced enthusiastically around the world.
Evidence for the effectiveness of workplace and school closures, in particular, was “very low” and they were ethically problematic given the imposition on parents and a significant fall in “the economy and productivity of a society”, the WHO argued.
The carefully footnoted 200-plus-page report, which looked at hundreds of academic studies across recent decades, was even disdainful of travel restrictions.
