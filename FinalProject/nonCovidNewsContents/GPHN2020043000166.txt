Title : The EU and covid-19:Back to the place where we were not happy
Ariticle : 
The EU has very limited powers to stop the pandemic, this or any other, because health powers remain fully within the sphere of the Member StatesAt the time I am writing, despite the dramatic evolution of the figures of the ubiquitous Covid-19 in the USA in recent weeks, the old Europe once again appears to be the epicenter of the spread of a wide-spectrum infectious disease, a candidate for the history books, after the black plague in the 14th century, and the Spanish flu a century ago.The bizarria of this finding is accentuated by the almost universal perception of the excellence of European health systems, in particular within the European Union (EU), the quality of scientific research, and by the still recent memory of the sophistication of European productive capacity.We have been surprised by the quez√≠lias, the reciprocal apportionment of blame, the uncoordinated reaction of the Member States, the overconfidence and, above all, the weaknesses in testing capacity and the 
difficulty of access to medical equipment stocks. The EU's industrial and technological ruin was, despite all the signs, yet unexpectedly unfurled before our eyes as we waited for rescue planes from Asia.We were shocked by the little solidarity of stocks, the disorganised closure of borders and the shocking impreparation of the leaders, witnessed by the dismissal / resignation of four EU health ministers in this period, one of whom, ironically, to apply for the Paris chamber, another, unfortunately, as a result of a real estate scandal.Despite all these more or less announced surprises, the anti-European vociferousness, the prophecies of disintegration of the EU and the resurgence of the North-South war within the Union may be manifestly exaggerated. What is extraordinary, in fact, is the insistence of Europeans, with each crisis, to seek in the EU hybrid monster solutions that it has never been prepared to offer, at the will of the Europeans, after all, in an eternal return to a place where we insist on not being happy.The truth, rarely stated, is that the EU has very limited powers to stop the pandemic, this or any other, because health skills remain fully within the member states, and not even shared competences, as is the case, for example, with policies for the agricultural sector. The EU may, under Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty), encourage cooperation, give advice, make recommendations, but it can be (and is) ostensibly ignored.This inability to intervene by the EU is apparently the result of the will of the Member States, which will emanate from their citizens in order to maintain the social status, their mega budgets, and their internal political impact at national level.General public health reasons can also be strained to remove the "Holy Grail" from EU policies, economic freedoms, including freedoms of movement, in accordance with Article 36 and Article 45 of the Treaty.But the Treaty also includes a clause of solidarity, Article 222, which allows assistance to Member States in certain exceptional circumstances, including cases of natural disasters. This provision has served as a basis not only for the establishment of the usual committees, panels and expert groups to assess the risks of the current situation, but also to seek to rationalise the storage of medical equipment and, in matters which are particularly expensive to us, to adjust, exceptionally, the general prohibition of State aid (in accordance with Article 107 et seq.the Treaty) in order to allow exceptional aid packages and tax escape clauses, as well as to relax restrictions on competition law for cooperation between operators in the health sector.In the face of the above, we must paradoxically conclude that the regret of Brexiters and Eurosceptics directed at the excessive power of Brussels bureaucrats quickly turns, in times of crisis, into a general complaint about Brussels' weakness in preventing each Member State from giving priority to its "own".Linking to Brussels which regulates in detail the handling of balloons or fruit form defects with Brussels devoid of any power in health or, only, an economy capable of countering the growing industrial dependence of third countries, by itself, without the unwanted return to nationalism and protectionism, is a reflection that Europeans cannot continue to postpone until the next crisis , under penalty of increasing worsening of the fragility of the ties that sustain us.
